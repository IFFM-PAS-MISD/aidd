\note{My name is Pawel Kudela. 
I am an associate professor at the Institute of Fluid Machinery, Polish Academy of Sciences.
I will give you a few lectures in the frame of the doctoral school.
Today's topic is a Fourier transform.
You can look at the Fourier transform from various perspectives such as mathematical formula or numerical algorithm.
But my intention is to give you some intuition about the mathematics behind the Fourier transform and look at it from engineer perspective so you can confidently use it as a tool in your particular problem.
I will be using Matlab to illustrate examples of practical applications of the Fourier transform.}

\note{I will start with the mathematical formulation of the \textbf{Continuous Fourier Transform}.
Next, I will move to the \textbf{Discrete Fourier Transform}.
I will cover also inverse Fourier Transform. 
Then, I will explain how to apply Fourier transforms to selected problem of mechanics which will be \textbf{Heat transfer problem}. 
Finally I will show you a few examples of \textbf{Signal filtering} and \textbf{Image filtering}.
At the end you will be given an \textbf{Assignment} so I encourage you to listen carefully.}

\note{Jean-Baptiste Joseph Fourier was a French mathematician and physicist best known for initiating the investigation of Fourier series.
Fourier, the son of a tailor, first attended the local military school conducted by Benedictine monks. 
It is said that he saved wax from the candle ends so that he could study at night.
He showed such proficiency in mathematics in his early years that he later became a teacher in mathematics at the same school. 	
As a student, he received lessons from eminent teachers like Lagrange, Laplace and Monge.
After passing out from school, he entered the Benedictine abbey with the intention of becoming a priest. 
However, he slowly became involved in politics; joined the local Revolutionary Committee.
He was imprisoned briefly during the French Revolution.	
In 1798 Fourier accompanied Napoleon on his expedition to Egypt. 
He was engaged in extensive research on Egyptian antiquities, gave advice on engineering and diplomatic undertakings.
On his return, Napoleon appointed him Prefect (Governor) of the Department of Is\`{e}re in Grenoble. 
He showed great administrative ability while continuing his Egyptological and mathematical work.
At that time, he began to experiment on the propagation of heat.
And here our story begins.

\note{Fourier was obsessed with the physics of heat and developed the Fourier series and transform to model heat-flow problems.
He had an idea that any periodic function can be rewritten as a weighted sum of sines and cosines of different frequencies.
The resulting wave is periodic, but not harmonic.

\note{Fourier transform is an equation. 
It is a result of a transformation or mapping between one domain and other domain.
Forward Fourier transform is a mapping between the time domain \(t\) and the frequency domain \(\omega\).
Inverse Fourier transfor is a mapping  between the frequency domain  \(\omega\) and the time domain \(t\).}
