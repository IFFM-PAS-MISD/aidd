\note{My name is Pawel Kudela. 
I am an associate professor at the Institute of Fluid Machinery, Polish Academy of Sciences.
I will give you a few lectures in the frame of the doctoral school.
Today's topic is a Fourier transform.
You can look at the Fourier transform from various perspectives such as mathematical formula or numerical algorithm.
But my intention is to give you some intuition about the mathematics behind the Fourier transform and look at it from engineer perspective so you can confidently use it as a tool in your particular problem.
I will be using Matlab to illustrate examples of practical applications of the Fourier transform.}

\note{I will start with the mathematical formulation of the \textbf{Continuous Fourier Transform}.
Next, I will move to the \textbf{Discrete Fourier Transform}.
I will cover also inverse Fourier Transform. 
Then, I will explain how to apply Fourier transforms to selected problem of mechanics which will be \textbf{Heat transfer problem}. 
Finally I will show you a few examples of \textbf{Signal filtering} and \textbf{Image filtering}.
At the end you will be given an \textbf{Assignment} so I encourage you to listen carefully.}
