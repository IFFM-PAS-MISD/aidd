\note{
This is the simples form of the wave equation. It is a second partial derivatives of physical quantity in respect to time equal to coefficient \(\upsilon_p\) square times a second partial derivative in respect to space. The coefficient  \(\upsilon_p\)  usually refers to wave velocity.
This equation can describe the problem of taut string, sound waves, electromechanical waves and longitudinal waves propagating in a rod.
Of course psi has different quantity for each penomenon; for vibrating taut string it will be the displacement, for sound waves it will be the pressure. 
Electromagnetic waves are created by a fusion of electric and magnetic fields.
Whereas propagating waves in a rod will be considered in terms of longitudinal displacements.
It is interesting to note that electromagnetic waves do not need a medium to travel.
It is also important to mention that propagating waves transmits energy from one point to another but without transporting a mass. 
Propagating waves can also be used for sending information.

\begin{frame}{Types of wave}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
	Various classifications of elastic waves can be used. 
	Based on oscillation form:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item standing waves
		\item propagating (progressing) waves
	\end{itemize}
	Based on analysed physical quantity:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item electromagnetic waves (Microwaves, X-ray, radio waves, ultraviolet waves)
		\item mechanical waves (water waves, ultrasonic waves, elastic waves, guided waves)
		\item matter waves
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\note{\footnotesize
There are many types of waves that it is easy to get confused. 
That is why we will start with the basic principles first and we will progress then towards more complex problems.
Based on oscilation form we can divide waves into standing waves and propagating or progressing waves.
An example of standing waves would be vibrating guitar string or structure vibrating at harmonic frequency.
An example of propagating waves will be sound wave or seismic wave.

Based on analysed physical quantity we can distinguish electromagnetic waves, mechanical waves and matter waves.
All light waves such as Microwaves, X-ray, radio waves, ultraviolet waves are examples of electromagnetic waves. 
They can propagate through a vacuum.
In opposite to electromagnetic waves, mechanical waves are not capable of transmitting its energy through the vacuum.
Mechanical waves require a medium in order to transport their energy from one location to another. It has a form of oscilations of particles in a medium.
Elastic and guided waves, on which I will elaborate more, belongs to the group of propagating mechanical waves. 

Matter waves sometimes are called de Broglie Matter Waves after the name of scientist who proposed a new speculative hypothesis that electrons and other particles of matter can behave like waves. 
Now it is a central part of the theory of quantum mechanics, being an example of wave–particle duality.

Acoustic waves based on wave frequency can be divided into:
\begin{itemize}
		\item infrasonic waves:  0.001 Hz - 20 Hz (earthquakes monitoring)
		\item sound waves (audible): 20 Hz - 20 kHz 
		\item ultrasonic waves (non-audible for humans): above 20 kHz
		\begin{itemize}
			\item chemistry (sonication, ultrasonication, mixing, production of nanoparticles)
			\item food processing (mixing, homogenization, emulsification): 20 kHz - 1MHz
			\item medical applications (e.g. ultrasonic nebulizer) and non-destructive testing 20 kHz - 2 MHz
			\item diagnostics and NDE 2 MHz - 200 MHz

\note{
Our body's physical sensors respond to oscillations with a well defined wavelength and frequency — We personally detect two kinds of waves in our environment to help us build a picture of the world we live in: sound and light. 
Our detectors for these waves — ears and eyes — are evolved to respond differently to different frequencies, giving us perception of pitch and color. 
As a result, an analysis in signals in terms of sinusoidal oscillations tends to make sense to us.
Voice frequency band ranges from approximately 300 to 3400 Hz.

Elastic waves are mechanical waves propagating in an elastic medium as an effect of forces associated with volume deformation (compression and extension) and shape deformation (shear) of medium elements.

\note{We will start with very simple equation: y equal one third of x which is the equation of stright line as it is shown here.
Let's suppose that I want this line to move,
Move it with a speed of 6 meters per second.
All I have to do now is to replace the x in the equation by x minus six t.
Notice the minus sign, it means that our line will go to plus x direction.
The equation becomes: y equal one third of x minus six t.
And at the time t equal zero you already have the line.
At t equal one the line is parallel and it moved in this direction with the speed of six meters per second.
So it is telling us that if we ever wanted to move with the speed v in the plus direction all we have to do is replace in our equation x with x minus v times t
and if we want to move in minus x direction we need to replace x with x minus v times t.

\note{\footnotesize Now I'm going to change to something which is real wave.
y equal to twice sine of three x; that's a wave, it is not moving yet.
And lambda which we call wavelength in this case is two pi over three.
We can also define lambda between consequtive wave peaks.
I will introduce new symbol k which we call wavenumber and k is simply defined as
two pi over lambda, so in our case it is three. If you know this number you can immediately tell what the wavelenght is.
Now I want to have this wave to move. 
I want to have travelling wave.
And I want to move it with the speed of 6 meters per secund in the positive direction.
So the receipe is very simple.
All I have to do is to replace x by x minus six t.
And now if you look at this equation and plot it a little bit later than time t zero you will see that indeed it has moved in the positive direction.
And it is moving with the speed of 6 meters per sucund.
So this equation holds all characteristics of the oscilation.
It holds the amplitude which is 2. 
k holds the information about the wavelenght and this information tells you what the speed is and a minus sign, which is important, tells you that it propagates in positive direction.
If we want to have travelling wave to the left or munus direction we have to have plus sign here.
Peaks of the wave denoted by blue dots are called wave crests and valleys denoted by red dots are called troughs.

\note{We can make such a travelling wave by attaching a string to a wheel rotating with angular frequency omega and radius R. 
If the radius has two units it will give us the same amplitude.
So the one period of oscilation is two pi over omega.
The wave is going to propagate with velocity v.
Hence, in order to travel the distance Lambda we need to multiply velocity v by one period T which gives us wavelength.
We can also define freqency as as ratio of velocity to wavelenght.
And now I can write the equation in somewhat different form in which we can distinct spatial part and time part.
This is wavenumber k and this is now angular frequecy omega.
Then I can find velocity which is omega over k.

\note{
Standing wave (stationary wave) is the wave that remains in a constant position. 
There is no shifting of the waveform; waveform goes always throgh the same nodes.
Stadning waves can arise due to interference. The sum of two counter propagating waves (of equal amplitude and frequency) creates standing wave.
Standing waves commonly arise when a boundary blocks further propagation of the wave, thus causing wave reflection, and therefore introducing a counter propagating wave (such example is a guitar string).
	
Let's suppose that I have travelling wave in right direction and I have another wave which is exactly identical in terms of amplitude, but it is travelling in opposite direction.
This plus sign tells me that it is going in this direction.
So if this is a string the net result is the sum of the two.
By employing trigonometric manipulation like this we can get this equation:
Notice that the amplitude has doubled.
And this is very different from travelling wave.
Nowhere you will see kx minus omega t.
All the timing information is separete from the spatial information.

\note{
On the upper figure, bulk waves are introduced to the structure by the transducer head.
They are propagating through the thickness of inspected element. 
Based on the characteristics of bulk waves such as velocity and amplitude of reflected signal we can assess only small area but with quite high precision regarding defect occurence. Then we need to move the transducer head to inspect other part of the structure.

On the lower figure, waves are guided by the shape of the structural element. 
Hence the name - guided waves. 
You can imagine that this is a pipe transporting for example gas or oil and there is a device in the form of a ring of transducers which excite elastic waves. 
Similar ring of transducers can be placed far away and register incoming waves.
 If there is any anomaly, change of waveform, it would mean that there is a damage in between transducer rings. 
 In this way inspected area is very large. 
 Actuators and sensors can be placed permanently and the structure can be monitored online. 
 However, the precision of inspection can be lower than in case of ultrasonic testing.

Elastic wave propagation types depending on particle motion:
\begin{itemize}
	\item  \alert{The longitudinal wave}is a compressional wave in which the particle motion is in the same direction as the propagation of the wave
	\item \alert{The shear wave} is a wave motion in which the particle motion is perpendicular to the direction of the propagation
	\item \alert{Surface (Rayleigh) waves} have an elliptical particle motion and travel across the surface of a material. Their velocity is approximately 90\% of the shear wave velocity of the material and their depth of penetration is approximately equal to one
	wavelength
	\item \alert{Plate (Lamb) waves} have a complex vibration occurring in materials where thickness is less than the wavelength of elastic wave introduced into it.
\end{itemize}

\note{
	The most common methods of ultrasonic examination utilize either
	longitudinal waves or shear waves. Other forms of elastic wave propagation exist,
	including surface waves and Lamb waves.
