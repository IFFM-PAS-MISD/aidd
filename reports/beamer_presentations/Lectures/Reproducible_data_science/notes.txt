Revising, Borrowing, Handing off, Accountability

Make:

- raw data,

- code & documentation to reproduce analysis,

- specifications of your computational environment

available and acessible

"There is no one-size-fits-all solution for computational reproducibility."

1. Organize your project

2. Write READMEs liberally

3. Keep data tidy & machine readable

4. Comment your code

5. Use literate programming

Rmarkdown (written in a plain text), notebooks?

6. Use version control

7. Automate your process

8. Share your computing environment

Painful bits:

- Coming up with good names

- stages of data cleaning

- going back and redoing stuff

- adding interim steps

- keeping track of order of things

- clutter of unneeded old stuff (folder 'unused')
