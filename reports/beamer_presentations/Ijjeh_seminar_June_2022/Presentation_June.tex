\section{Composite laminates}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Defects of composite laminates}
\begin{frame}{Defects of composite materials}

	\begin{minipage}[c]{.40\textwidth}			
		Composite materials can have several kinds of defects such as:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Cracks
			\item Fibre breakage
			\item Debonding		
			\item Delamination 
		\end{itemize}
	\textbf{Delamination} is one of the most hazardous forms of the defects. 
	It leads to very catastrophic failures if not detected at early stages.
	\end{minipage}
	\hfill
	\begin{minipage}[c]{0.55\textwidth}
		\begin{figure}[h!]
			\centering
			\vspace{-10pt}
			\includegraphics[width=.7\textwidth]{damage_composites.png}
		\end{figure}
	\end{minipage}
\end{frame}
\note{
	Generally, impact damage in composite materials is caused by various impact events that result from the lack of reinforcement in the out-of-plane direction.
	Causing: 
	Matrix cracks, 
	Fibre breakage, 
	Debonding (occurs when an adhesive stops adhering to an adherend) 
	And delamination, as shown in the figure, which can alter the compression strength of composite laminate and gradually affect the composite to encounter failure by buckling.
	Among these defects in composites, delamination is considered one of the most hazardous types of defects. 
	That is because delamination can seriously decrease the performance of the composite.
	Therefore, delamination detection in the early stages can help to avoid structural collapses.
	}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Damage detection in composite laminates}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}{Conventional approaches}
	Conventional structural damage detection methods involve two processes:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Feature extraction 
		\item Feature classification	
	\end{itemize}
	\subfloat{\includegraphics[width=.95\textwidth]{conventional_ML.png}}
		Drawbacks of Conventional methods:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Requires a great amount of human labor and computational effort.
		\item Demands a high amount of experience of the practitioner.
		\item Inefficient with big data which requires a complex computation of damage features.  
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}
\note{
	In conventional damage detection methods, to detect the damage, first, we must analyse the response of structure obtained by sensors such as (PZTs) that can sense for example the generated guided waves (e.g. Lamb waves). 
	Then, we need to extract the features of response  (which requires large computational effort). 
	Then we can attempt to classify these features, which are sensitive to minor damage and that can be distinguished from the response to natural and environmental changes (baseline).
	}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\note{
	Conventional methods of damage detection focus on patterns
	extraction from registered measurements and accordingly make decisions based on these patterns. 
	Moreover, conventional methods for pattern recognition require feature selection and classification (handcrafted features). 
	These conventional methods can perform efficient damage detection. However, these methods depend on selected features from their scope of measurement. 
	Accordingly, introducing new patterns will cause them to fail in detecting the damage.
	Furthermore, these methods could fail in detecting damage when dealing with big data requiring a complex computation of damage features.

\subsection{Introducing deep learning}

\begin{frame}{What is deep learning?}

\end{frame}

\note{
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Artificial intelligence (AI) refers to a broader field of computer science. 
		AI aims to enable machines to think without human intervention
		\item Machine Learning (ML) is a subset of AI, that uses statistical learning algorithms to build smart systems.
		\item Deep learning is a subset of ML. 
		It was inspired by the information processing patterns observed in the human brain (Neural Network). 
		Just like humans use their brain to identify patterns and classify various types of information. 
		Deep learning algorithms as Artificial Neural Network (ANN) can be taught to perform the same tasks for machines.
		\item Deep Learning is the most exciting and powerful branch of Machine Learning. 
		It's a technique that teaches computers to do what comes naturally to humans: learn by example. 
		Deep learning is a key technology behind driver-less cars, enabling them to recognize a stop sign or to distinguish a pedestrian from a lamppost. It is the key to voice control in consumer devices like phones, tablets, TVs, and hands-free speakers. Deep learning is getting lots of attention lately and for good reason. 
		It’s achieving results that were not possible before.

\begin{frame}{Deep learning, why now?}
	\begin{minipage}[c]{0.4\textwidth}
		AI technologies are in accelerating growth due to:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Exponential development in computer hardware industries
			 (e.g. CPUs, GPUs, FPGAs, TPUs and ASICs)
			\item Era of Big data, 	
		\end{itemize}

		\end{figure}	
	\end{minipage}
	
\end{frame}
\note{
	In recent years, the field of AI has been developed in the accelerating rate due to:
	the advanced evolution occurred in technology that produced high computational powers \\
	like Central Processing Units, Graphical Processing Units,
	Field Programmable Gate Arrays, Tensor Processing Units, and Application Specific Integrated Circuit.\\
	The second thing that causes AI to be in accelerating growth is that in recent years the era of big data began, which is extremely essential in the learning process of AI systems.\\
	We can say that deep learning techniques rapidly developed after AlexNet was developed.
	AlexNet is the name of a convolutional neural network which has had a large impact on the field of machine learning, specifically in the application of deep learning to computer vision. 
	It famously won the 2012 ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge-2012 competition which was a breakthrough.}

\note{
	The idea behind perceptrons or (artificial neurons) is that it is possible to mimic certain parts of biological neurons, such as dendrites, cell bodies and axons using a simplified mathematical models of what limited knowledge we have on their inner workings: 
	signals can be received from dendrites, and sent down the axon once enough signals were received. 
	This outgoing signal can then be used as another input for other neurons, repeating the process. 
	Some signals are more important than others and can trigger some neurons to fire easier. 
	Connections can become stronger or weaker, new connections can appear while others can cease to exist. 
	We can mimic most of this process by coming up with a function that receives a list of weighted input signals and outputs some kind of signal if the sum of these weighted inputs reaches a certain threshold value.}

	A basic ANN is composed of three layers:\\
