\section{Introduction}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Composite materials}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}{Composite materials}

	Composites materials are formed by combining materials together to form an overall structure with properties that differ from that of the individual components as shown in the below image.

	\tiny {Image source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Composite\_material}

\end{frame}
\note{
	A composite material can be defined as a combination of a matrix and a reinforcement, which when combined gives properties superior to the properties of the individual components. \\
	The reinforcement fibres (e.g Glass, carbon) can be cut, aligned, placed in different ways to affect the properties of the resulting composite.
	The matrix, normally a form of resin (e.g polyester, epoxy), keeps the reinforcement in the desired orientation. \\
	It protects the reinforcement from chemical and environmental attack, and it bonds the reinforcement so that applied loads can be effectively transferred.
	The Gray layer is a protection for the composite. 
	}

		\begin{figure}[h!]
			\centering
			\vspace{-2cm}
			\includegraphics[scale=1]{composite_materials.png}
		\end{figure}
	\end{wrapfigure}
	\textbf{Examples of Composite Uses:}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Aerospace structures
		\item Automotive
		\item Energy %(e.g. wind turbines)
		\item Infrastructure (e.g. bridges, roads, railways,...)
		\item Pipes and tanks
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}
\note{
	Composite materials have enormous life application:
	in aerospace applications like components of the aircraft (whether business or military), rockets and missiles etc.\\	
	In the Automobile industries for example (steel and aluminium body). \\
	In the energy application, composites are used in wind turbines.\\ 
	In infrastructures, composites have so many applications for example bridges, roads, railways, in communication antennae, etc.\\
	Now, why to use composite materials? 
	As shown in the figure, composites have so many advantages over metals such as their lightweight, flexibility in design, can embed instruments like sensors (FBGs to monitor the structure), their capability to perform better regarding fatigue strength, their lower cost, their capability to resists corrosion caused by environmental causes,  and other advantages.
	}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Defects in composite materials}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}{Problems of composite materials}
	Composite materials can have several kinds of defects such as:
	\begin{wrapfigure}{r}{0.5\textwidth}
		\begin{figure}[h!]
			\centering
			\vspace{-10pt}
			\includegraphics[width=0.48\textwidth]{delamination1.png}
		\end{figure}
	\end{wrapfigure}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Cracks
		\item Fibre breakage
		\item Debonding		
		\item Delamination 
	\end{itemize}
	Among these defects, delamination is one of the most hazardous forms of the defects, which essentially leads to very catastrophic failures if not detected at early stages.
	
	\tiny {Image source: https://docplayer.biz.tr/151413952-Tabakali-kompozitlerde-yapraklanma-delamination-bolgesinin-burkulma-mukavemetine-etkileri.html}
\end{frame}
\note{
	Generally, impact damage in composite materials is caused by various impact events that result from the lack of reinforcement in the out-of-plane direction.
	Causing: 
	Matrix cracks, 
	Fibre breakage, 
	Debonding (occurs when an adhesive stops adhering to an adherend) 
	And delamination, as shown in the figure, which can alter the compression strength of composite laminate and gradually affect the composite to encounter failure by buckling.
	Among these defects in composites, delamination is considered one of the most hazardous types of defects. 
	That is because delamination can seriously decrease the performance of the composite.
	Therefore, delamination detection in the early stages can help to avoid structural collapses.
	}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Damage detection in composite materials}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}{Damage detection in composite materials}
		\begin{wrapfigure}{r}{0.5\textwidth}
		\begin{figure}[h!]
			\centering
			\vspace{-2.5cm}
			\hspace{-2.0cm}
			\includegraphics[width=0.55\textwidth]{GW_LambWaves.png}
		\end{figure}
	\end{wrapfigure}
	Conventional structural damage detection methods involve two processes:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Feature extraction 
		\item Feature classification	
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}
\note{
	In conventional damage detection methods, to detect the damage, first, we must analyse the response of structure obtained by sensors such as (PZTs) that can sense for example the generated guided waves (e.g. Lamb waves). 
	Then, we need to extract the features of response  (which requires large computational effort). 
	Then we can attempt to classify these features, which are sensitive to minor damage and that can be distinguished from the response to natural and environmental changes (baseline).
	}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}{Damage detection in composite materials Cont.}
	Drawbacks of Conventional methods:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Requires a great amount of human labor and computational effort.
		\item Demands a high amount of experience of the practitioner.
		\item Inefficient with big data which requires a complex computation of damage features.  
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}
\note{
	Conventional methods of damage detection focus on patterns
	extraction from registered measurements and accordingly make decisions based on these patterns. 
	Moreover, conventional methods for pattern recognition require feature selection and classification (handcrafted features). 
	These conventional methods can perform efficient damage detection. However, these methods depend on selected features from their scope of measurement. 
	Accordingly, introducing new patterns will cause them to fail in detecting the damage.
	Furthermore, these methods could fail in detecting damage when dealing with big data requiring a complex computation of damage features.

\end{frame}

\note{
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Artificial intelligence (AI) refers to a broader field of computer science. 
		AI aims to enable machines to think without human intervention
		\item Machine Learning (ML) is a subset of AI, that uses statistical learning algorithms to build smart systems.
		\item Deep learning is a subset of ML. 
		It was inspired by the information processing patterns observed in the human brain (Neural Network). 
		Just like humans use their brain to identify patterns and classify various types of information. 
		Deep learning algorithms as Artificial Neural Network (ANN) can be taught to perform the same tasks for machines.
		\item Deep Learning is the most exciting and powerful branch of Machine Learning. 
		It's a technique that teaches computers to do what comes naturally to humans: learn by example. 
		Deep learning is a key technology behind driverless cars, enabling them to recognize a stop sign or to distinguish a pedestrian from a lamppost. It is the key to voice control in consumer devices like phones, tablets, TVs, and hands-free speakers. Deep learning is getting lots of attention lately and for good reason. 
		It’s achieving results that were not possible before.

\note{
In recent years, the field of AI has been developed in the accelerating rate due to:
the advanced evolution occurred in technology that produced high computational powers \\
like Central Processing Units, Graphical Processing Units,
Field Programmable Gate Arrays, Tensor Processing Units, and Application Specific Integrated Circuit.\\
The second thing that causes AI to be in accelerating growth is that in recent years the era of big data began, which is extremely essential in the learning process of AI systems.\\
We can say that deep learning techniques rapidly developed after AlexNet was developed.
AlexNet is the name of a convolutional neural network which has had a large impact on the field of machine learning, specifically in the application of deep learning to computer vision. 
It famously won the 2012 ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge-2012 competition which was a breakthrough.	}

\note{
	The idea behind perceptrons or (artificial neurons) is that it is possible to mimic certain parts of biological neurons, such as dendrites, cell bodies and axons using a simplified mathematical models of what limited knowledge we have on their inner workings: 
	signals can be received from dendrites, and sent down the axon once enough signals were received. 
	This outgoing signal can then be used as another input for other neurons, repeating the process. 
	Some signals are more important than others and can trigger some neurons to fire easier. 
	Connections can become stronger or weaker, new connections can appear while others can cease to exist. 
	We can mimic most of this process by coming up with a function that receives a list of weighted input signals and outputs some kind of signal if the sum of these weighted inputs reaches a certain threshold value.}

\note{
Artificial Neural Networks or ANN is an information processing paradigm that is inspired by the way the biological nervous system such as brain process information. 
It is composed of a large number of highly interconnected processing elements(neurons) working together in harmony to solve a specific problem such as regression, classification, image detection and identification and in time series data.
A basic ANN is composed of three layers:\\
the input layer, the hidden layer or layers and finally an output layer.
Information flows from the input layer, through the hidden layer to the output layer.

\note{
Feature extraction (aka feature engineering) is the process of putting domain knowledge into the creation of feature extractors to reduce the complexity of the data and make patterns more visible to learning algorithms. \\
This process is difficult and expensive in terms of time and expertise.
The shown diagram summaries the core distinction between machine learning and deep learning techniques. \\
For the classical machine learning techniques, we have to perform feature extraction by ourselves, then we use a suitable method to do the classification. \\
On the contrary, in deep learning techniques, the process of feature extraction is done automatically without the need for human intervention, since the model will learn by itself to perform this process.

\begin{frame}{Objective of the Project}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item To develop an AI driven diagnostic model for delamination identification in composite laminates such as carbon fibre reinforced polymers (CFRP).

\end{frame}
\note{
Our main objectives in this project are to explore the feasibility of using an AI approach in detecting defects such as delaminations in composite laminates such as carbon fibre reinforced polymers (CFRP). \\

Numerically generating 475 cases of full wavefield of propagating Lamb waves in a plate made of CFRP as shown in the figure. \\
Essentially, the output resembles measurements acquired by SLDV in the transverse direction (perpendicular to the plate surface). \\
Each delamination with different shape, size and location was modelled randomly on the plate.\\ 
To improve the delamination visibility Root mean square RMS was applied.
The dataset is used to train the deep learning models in order to identify the delaminations..

Computer Vision, often abbreviated as CV, is defined as a field of study that seeks to develop techniques to help computers “see” and understand the content of digital images such as photographs and videos.\\
Many popular computer vision applications involve trying to recognize things in photographs; for example, \\
Image classification concerns what broad categories are there in the image. \\
Object detection and localisation concerns with whare are the objects in the image.\\
and Image segmentation which is the process of partitioning an image into multiple segments.  Image segmentation is typically used to locate objects and boundaries (lines, curves, etc.) in images. 
More precisely, image segmentation is the process of assigning a label to every pixel in an image such that pixels with the same label share certain characteristics.

\begin{frame}{Convolutional Neural Network CNN}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item CNN is a type of feedforward ANNs which additionally performs convolution operations  
		\item CNNs are designed to handle data as tensors with different dimensions such as: 1D signals, 2D and 3D images and sequence of images (videos)in 4D.
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}
\note{
The convolutional neural network, or CNN for short, is a specialized type of neural network model designed for working with two-dimensional image data, although they can be used with one-dimensional and three-dimensional data. \\
Central to the convolutional neural network is the convolutional layer that gives the network its name. This layer performs an operation called a “convolution“.\\	
CNNs are primarily used in applications of CV (previously mentioned).\\
The innovation of convolutional neural networks is the ability to automatically learn a large number of filters in parallel specific to a training dataset under the constraints of a specific predictive modelling problem, such as image classification. The result is highly specific features that can be detected anywhere on input images.

	Typical architecture of a CNN consists of three main parts:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Convolutional layer
		\item Downsampling layer
		\item Dense layer
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}
\note{
In the context of a convolutional neural network, convolution is a linear operation that involves the multiplication of a set of weights with the input, much like a traditional neural network. 
Given that the technique was designed for two-dimensional input, the multiplication is performed between an array of input data and a two-dimensional array of weights, called a filter or a kernel. \\
The filter is smaller than the input data and the type of multiplication applied between a filter-sized patch of the input and the filter is a dot product. 		
The output of multiplying the filter with the input array one time is a single value. 
As the filter is applied multiple times to the input array, the result is a two-dimensional array of output values that represent filtering of the input.
The two-dimensional output array from this operation is called a “feature map“.	
Once a feature map is created, we can pass each value in the feature map through a nonlinearity, such as a ReLU, much like we do for the outputs of a fully connected layer.
After the feature maps are produced, downsampling is applied to reduce the spatial resolution on the exact positioning of features within networks.
Finally, the feature maps are flattened and input into the dense layer.

\note{
The idea behind FCN is to stack a group of convolutional layers in an
encoder-decoder style. \\
The encoder is capable for downsampling the input image through convolutions with strides, consequently, resulting in a compressed feature representation of the input image, and the decoder is capable to upsample the image with compressed features applying techniques like transposed convolution with strides and upsampling with interpolation (e.g. bilinear or nearest).

Finally, in this slide, we present an abstract level of how FCN models perform Image segmentation to identify the delamination as shown in the figure.
The input to the model is an RMS Image with delamination located almost at the upper middle of the image. 
The FCN is responsible for performing image segmentation accordingly, Identifying the delamination as shown on the predicted damage on the right.
