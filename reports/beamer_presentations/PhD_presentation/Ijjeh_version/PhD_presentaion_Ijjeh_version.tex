	\section{Motivation}
	\begin{frame}{Defects in composite laminates}
		\small
		Composite laminates can have different types of damage such as: \\
		\textbf{Cracks, fibre breakage, debonding, and \alert{delamination}}.
		\begin{columns}[T]
			\begin{column}[c]{.45\textwidth}
				\begin{itemize}
					\footnotesize
					\item Delamination is a critical failure mechanism in laminated fibre-reinforced polymer matrix composites.
					\item Delamination is one of the most hazardous forms of the defects. 
					It leads to very catastrophic failures if not detected at early stages.
				\end{itemize}
			\end{column}

				\end{figure}
			\end{column}
		\end{columns}
	\end{frame}
	%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
	\note{
		Composite laminates have a wide range of applications in various industries, due to their characteristics such as high strength, low density, resistance to fatigue and corrosion among other characteristics.
		
		However, defects such as cracks, fiber breakage, and debonding can occur in composite laminates. 
		
		In particular, laminated composite materials are more sensitive to damage in the form of delamination due to weak transverse tensile and interlaminar shear strengths.
		
		Delamination can alter the compression strength of composite laminate, and gradually affect the composite to encounter failure by buckling.
		
		Delaminations can seriously decrease the performance of composite structures, accordingly, delamination detection in its early stages can significantly help to avoid catastrophic structural collapses.

	\section{Objectives}
	\begin{frame}{Objectives}
		\textbf{To develop \textcolor{blue}{a novel AI-driven diagnostic system} for delamination identification in composite laminates such as carbon fibre reinforced polymers (CFRP).}
		\vfil
		\textbf{To address the issue of \textcolor{blue}{slow data acquisition} by SLDV of high-resolution full wavefields of Lamb wave propagation.}
		\begin{alertblock}{Thesis}
			It is possible to use an end-to-end approach in which DNN 
			processes the animation of propagating waves (input) directly into a damage map (output).
		\end{alertblock}
	\end{frame}
	%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
	\note{
		The main objective of this work is to develop an artificial intelligence (AI)-driven diagnostic system to detect delamination in composite laminates.
		Accordingly, I explored the concept of the end-to-end approach by utilizing animations of Lamb wave propagation in a plate interacting with discontinuities such as damage and edges, with an artificial intelligence-based approach to to detect and identify delamination.
		
		My second objective is to address the issue of slow data acquisition of
		high-resolution full wavefields of Lamb wave propagation by SLDV.

	%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
	\note{
		Structural health monitoring is about monitoring a structure periodically or continuously to assess its technical conditions.
		So, the idea is to place integrated sensors on the structure to continuously monitor the structure to assess its conditions.
		In this way, structural health monitoring somehow mimics the human nervous system, which can give us real-time readings and detect any abnormal event.
		Consequently, this is the ultimate aim of SHM: to monitor in real-time in a way that can detect damage early so we can perform preventive measures to protect the structure.

		There are a number of conventional methods that were used for long time in the industry for damage inspection such as:Visual inspection, Eddy current, Dye penetration, Acoustic emission and local Ultrasonic testing.
		For the local ultrasonic testing, the frequency is in range of (2 MHz- 200 MHz) and the wavelength is way smaller than the thickness of structure.
		There are different methods for ultrasonic testing such as:
		Pulse echo in which we have a probe that generates ultrasonic waves  that propagate through the thickness of structure, then the reflected waves from the bottom surface are captured by the same probe.
		The other ultrasonic method is called through-transmission method.
		In which there are two probes one for transmitting on one side and second one for receiving on the other side.
		Hence these methods are local it has some disadvantages:
		Labor intensive, Time consuming, Need professional and experienced personnel, May require the disassembly of complex structures.
		On the other hand, guided wave testing are a promising global NDE solution for SHM.
		The typical frequency range of Guided waves is 10 KHz to 1 MHz, and their wavelength is larger than the thickness of the investigated structure.
		Guided waves can be generated using Piezoelectric actuator and registered by an array of Piezoelectric sensors. 
		Alternatively, the propagation of guided Lamb waves can be registered using scanning laser Doppler vibrometer to produce a full wavefield scan.

	\begin{frame}{Conventional vs deep learning approach}
		Conventional methods involve two processes:
		\alert{\textbf{Feature extraction and classification}}
%		\begin{itemize}
%			\item \alert{\textbf{Feature extraction}} \(\rightarrow\) includes signals preprocessing (signal denoising and averaging), then extracting \textbf{damage indexes (DIs)}.
%			\item \alert{\textbf{Feature classification}}\(\rightarrow\) the extracted features are classified, for instance, into healthy or damaged states.
%		\end{itemize}
		\begin{figure}

			\includegraphics[width=.95\textwidth]{conventional_ML.png}
		\end{figure}	
%		\textbf{Drawbacks of Conventional methods:}
%		\begin{itemize}
%			\item[$\times$]\alert{Requires a great amount of human labor and computational effort.}
%			\item[$\times$]\alert{Demands a high amount of experience of the practitioner.}
%			\item[$\times$]\alert{Inefficient with big data which requires a complex computation of damage features.} 
%		\end{itemize}
	
		Deep learning offers an \alert{\textbf{end-to-end}} approach: \alert{\textbf{Automatic}} feature extraction and classification.
		\begin{figure}
			\includegraphics[width=.95\textwidth]{DL_approach.png}
		\end{figure}
	\end{frame}
	%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
	\note{
		In this slide, I present a comparison between conventional machine learning approach of damage detection compared to a deep learning approach.
		
		In the conventional approaches two processes must be performed the first is to extract the useful features from the registered data then to use a proper classification technique.
		
		This approach has several drawback:
		first, it requires a great amount of human labor and computational effort
		secondly, it demands a high amount of experience of the practitioner.
		and lastly when dealing with big data it tends to be Inefficient as  it requires a complex computation of damage features extraction and classification.
		
		On the other hand, deep learning approach offers the opportunity to develop models that can automatically perform feature extraction and classification by themselves without human intervention in an end-to-end approach.

	\note{
			
		In this work, I utilised the supervised approach, which means that the input data is labeled.
		Accordingly, the idea of a supervised learning is to learn a model how to map the inputs to the outputs.
		
		Initially, when we start training deep learning model, all learnable parameters such as weights and biases start with random values of some fixed values.
		These learnable parameters are updated during the training phase.
		Now, in the forward pass we feed the data into the model and it flows through the layers until we get the predicted output.
		Here, we need an objective loss function to to estimate the loss (error) between the predicted output and the ground truth.

		A well-known optimization algorithm is the gradient descent, which aims to reduce the loss at each step to reach the global minimum value by calculating the gradient then is push back the calculated gradients across all the neurons in a technique called backpropagation.
		
		Accordingly, all learnable parameters are updated, which leads to minimizing the loss value.

	\note{
		We now reach an important concept, which is computer vision. 
		So, computer vision is a subcategory of AI that enables computers to obtain meaningful information from visual inputs.
		Hence, computer vision can have three levels of tasks: 
		The first task is to be able to perform a classification for the whole input and predict one output.
		
		The second task is to be able to classify as well as locate the object that we are looking for. 
		
		The ultimate level of computer vision is to perform Pixel-wise segmentation (or semantic segmentation), in which each pixel in the input image is classified into its corresponding class.

	\begin{frame}{Convolution Neural Networks (CNNs)}
		\noindent Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is one of the most utilised architectures in DL for image processing as they can \alert{recognise complex patterns} of images by performing \alert{convolution operations}.
		
		Convolution in DL is a cross-correlation operation \alert{(sliding dot product)}. \\
		The kernel weights \alert{(learnable weights)} are updated during training phase.

	%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
	\note{
		Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is a powerful deep learning architecture for image processing because it can \alert{extract complex feature patterns} from images using \alert{convolution operations}.
		
		The convolution operation for image processing is essentially a cross-correlation operation, also known as a sliding dot product or sliding inner-product.
		
		
		The kernel slides over an input image of performing a convolution operation.
		The output of the convolution operation is a feature map.
		
		Consequently, kernels learn to detect different types of edges
		(vertical, horizontal, and diagonal edges), colour intensities, etc.	
		
		Typically, when we train a CNN model, the kernel weights are initialised randomly.
		Accordingly, during the backpropagation process, all learnable parameters (kernel weights) are updated.

		Those selected frames that contain the required features about the damage shape and location are fed into an encoder-decoder model at once using a time distributed layer.
		
		The outputs of the decoder were forwarded into the ConvLSTM layer to learn the long-term spatio-temporal features.
		
		
		Now, for the real-life situations where the damage location is not known, the figure on the left illustrates the complete procedure of obtaining intermediate predictions for the testing cases and finally calculating the RMS image.

		In Specimen II, three large artificial delaminations of elliptic shape
		were inserted in the upper thickness quarter of the plate between the
		4th and the 5th layer.
		The delaminations were located at the same distance, equal to 150 mm from the centre of the plate. 
		
		For specimen III delaminations were inserted in the middle of the cross-section of the plate between 8th layer and 9th layer.
		For Specimen IV, three small delaminations were inserted in the upper quarter of the cross-section of the plate, and three large delaminations were inserted at the lower quarter of the cross-section of the plate between the 12th layer and 13th layer. 
		
		For a CFRP specimen on the right with a single delamination. 
		The delamination between layers of the fabric was created artificially by a Teflon insert of a thickness 250 \(\mu\)m. 
		The Teflon of a square shape was inserted during specimen 	manufacturing, so its shape and location are known.
		
		Furthermore, all SLDV measurements were conducted from the bottom surface of the plate.
			
		I would like to mention that the specimens on the left were brought specifically to my PhD project.

		Similarly to the numerical dataset, the best accuracy was achieved by using GCN.
		
		As shown, the models are capable of precise detection and localisation of the delamination. 
		We can see that the models can identify the delamination with almost free noise indicating the models are capable of generalising and detecting the delamination on previously unseen data.

	\begin{frame}{Conclusions}
		\footnotesize
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Full wavefields contain rich damage-related information
			\item Full wavefields can be utilised to train deep learning models to perform damage identification in an end-to-end approach
			\item Deep learning models trained on synthetic dataset generalise well and can be applied directly to experimental wavefields
			\item Animation-based deep learning models perform better than image-based models but are more complex and require longer time for training
			\item Deep learning approaches surpass the conventional signal processing techniques
			\item The DLSR model can speed up the process of data acquisition by SLDV (from LR measurements to HR measurements).
		\end{itemize}

	\begin{frame}[standout]{Dataset}
		\tiny
		\begin{itemize}
			\item The input signal was a five-cycle Hann window modulated sinusoidal tone burst. 
			\item The carrier frequency was assumed to be 50 kHz. 
			\item The total wave propagation time was set to 0.75 ms so that the guided wave could propagate to the plate edges and back to the actuator twice. 
			\item The number of time integration steps was 150000, which was selected for the stability of the central difference scheme.
			\item The material was a typical cross-ply CFRP laminate. 
			\item The stacking sequence \([0/90]_4\) was used in the model. 
			\item The properties of a single ply were as follows [GPa]: \(C_{11}=52.55,\ C_{12}=6.51,\ C_{22}=51.83,\ C_{44}=2.93,\ C_{55}=2.92,\ C_{66}=3.81\). 
			\item The assumed mass density was 1522.4 kg/\(m^3\). 
			\item These properties were selected so that wave front patterns and wavelengths simulated numerically are similar to the wavefields measured by the SLDV on CFRP specimens used later on for testing the developed methods for delamination identification. 
			\item The shortest wavelength of the propagating A0 Lamb wave mode was 21.2 mm for numerical simulations and 19.5 mm for experimental measurements, respectively.

	\begin{frame}[standout]{Composite Materials: Rule of mixture and homogenization}
	\small
	Composite materials have their micro-structure designed in terms of their macroscopic constituents, e.g. fibers in a homogeneous matrix material. 
	By controlling the choice of fibers, their volume fraction, and alignment, the mechanical properties may be tailored to meet specific design requirements.
	\begin{columns}[T]
		\begin{column}[t]{0.48\textwidth}
			The diagram (a) shows a 'uniaxial fiber-reinforced' composite material, and (b) shows how the stress on the composite is carried by the fibers and the matrix. 
			In normal situations, the fiber has a larger Young's modulus than the matrix, and for the continuous fibers shown, where the strain is the same in the matrix and the fiber, the fiber stress is higher than the matrix stress.
			\end{column}

			\end{figure}
		\end{column}
		\end{columns}	
		 The Young's modulus of the Composite is given by the 'rule of mixtures' i.e. \(E_C = E_F V_F + E_MV_M\) , also \((V_M + V_F) = 1\) or \(V_M = (1 - V_F )\). 
		 The elastic modulus along the fiber direction can be controlled by selecting the volume fraction of the fibers.
