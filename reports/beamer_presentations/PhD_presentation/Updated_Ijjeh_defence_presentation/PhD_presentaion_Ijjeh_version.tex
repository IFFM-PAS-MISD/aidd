	\note{
		Composite laminates have a wide range of applications in various industries due to their characteristics, such as high strength, low density, and resistance to fatigue and corrosion, among others.
		
		However, defects such as cracks, fibre breakage, and debonding can occur in composite laminates. 
		
		In particular, laminated composite materials are more sensitive to damage in the form of delamination due to weak transverse tensile and interlaminar shear strengths.
			
		Delaminations can seriously decrease the performance of composite structures.
		Accordingly, delamination detection in its early stages can significantly help to avoid catastrophic structural collapses.}

	\begin{frame}{Objectives}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item \textbf{To develop \textcolor{logoblue}{a novel AI-driven diagnostic system} for delamination identification in composite laminates such as carbon fibre reinforced polymers (CFRP).}
			\item \textbf{To address the issue of \textcolor{logoblue}{slow data acquisition} by SLDV of high-resolution full wavefields of Lamb wave propagation.}
		\end{itemize}
		\begin{tcolorbox}
			\begin{alertblock}{Thesis}
				It is possible to use an end-to-end approach in which DNN 
				processes the animation of propagating waves (input) directly into a damage map (output).
			\end{alertblock}
			\begin{alertblock}{Thesis}
				It is possible to speed up the data acquisition process by SLDV by employing an appropriate DL approach to recover high-resolution (HR) full wavefield scans  from a low-resolution (LR).

	%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
	\note{
		The main objective of this work is to develop an artificial intelligence-based diagnostic system for the detection of delaminations in composite laminates.
		
		Therefore, I investigated the possibility of embracing the end-to-end approach by using animations of Lamb wave propagation in a plate interacting with discontinuities such as damage and edges with an artificial intelligence-based approach to detect and identify delaminations.
		
		My second objective is to address the issue of slow data acquisition of high-resolution full wavefields of Lamb wave propagation by SLDV.}

		In this slide, I present the specifications of the specimens used for evaluating the developed deep-learning models.
		
		Specimens with multiple delaminations are shown on the left.
		
		In Specimen II, three large artificial delaminations of elliptic shape were inserted in the upper thickness quarter of the plate between the 4th and the 5th layer. 
		The delaminations were located at the same distance, equal to 150 mm from the centre of the plate. 
		
		In specimen III, delaminations were inserted in the middle of the cross-section of the plate between the 8th layer and the 9th layer.
		For Specimen IV, three small delaminations were inserted in the upper quarter of the cross-section of the plate, and three large delaminations were inserted at the lower quarter of the cross-section of the plate between the 12th layer and 13th layer. 
		
		The fifth specimen on the right has a single delamination. 
		The delamination between layers of the fabric was created artificially by a Teflon insert of a thickness 250 \(\mu\)m. 
		The Teflon of a square shape was inserted during specimen manufacturing, so its shape and location are known.
		
		Furthermore, all SLDV measurements were conducted from the bottom surface of the plate.
		
		I would like to mention that the specimens on the left were brought specifically to my PhD project.}

	\note{
		To train the supervised deep learning models, a synthetic dataset of propagating waves in carbon fibre-reinforced composite plates was computed by applying the Mindlin-Reissner plate theory and using the parallel implementation of the time domain spectral element method.
		
		For each case, single delamination was modeled by using the method of splitting nodes between appropriate spectral elements.
		
		Essentially, the dataset resembles the particle velocity measurements at the bottom surface of the plate acquired by the SLDV in the transverse direction as a response to the piezoelectric (PZT) excitation at the centre of the plate.

	\note{
		Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is a powerful deep learning architecture for image processing because it can extract complex feature patterns from images using convolution operations.
		
		The convolution operation for image processing is essentially a cross-correlation operation, also known as a sliding dot product or sliding inner product.
		
		The kernel slides over an input image of performing a convolution operation.
		The output of the convolution operation is a feature map.
		
		Consequently, kernels learn to detect different types of edges
		(vertical, horizontal, and diagonal edges), colour intensities, etc.	
		
		During the backpropagation process, all kernel weights are updated.

		Computer vision has three hierarchical levels: 
		
		The first level performs a classification for the whole input and predicts one output.
		
		The second level classifies and locates the object that we are looking for. 
		
		The ultimate level of computer vision is to perform Pixel-wise segmentation (or semantic segmentation), in which each pixel in the input image is classified into its corresponding class.

		In this slide, I present a comparison between conventional machine learning and deep learning approaches to damage detection.
		
		In the conventional approaches, two processes must be performed: 
		The first is to extract the useful features from the registered data and then use a proper classification technique.
		
		This approach has several drawbacks:
		First, it requires a great amount of human labor and computational effort
		Secondly, it demands a high amount of experience from the practitioner.
		And lastly, when dealing with big data, it tends to be Inefficient as it requires a complex computation of damage features extraction and classification.
		
		On the other hand, the deep learning approach offers the opportunity to develop models that can automatically perform feature extraction and classification by themselves without human intervention in an end-to-end approach.

		The novelty of this work consists of applying for the first time a full wavefield dataset of elastic wave propagation as an input to various supervised deep-learning models that are capable of identifying damage by classifying each output pixel as healthy or damaged. 
		
		Accordingly, two main approaches were adopted:	
		\begin{itemize}
			\item One-to-one approach (takes one input (RMS image) and produces one output of damage map)
			\item Many-to-one approach (takes animation of Lamb waves propagation as a sequence of frames and produces one output as damage map).

	\note{
		FCN-DenseNet applies an encoder-decoder scheme with skip connections between the encoder and the decoder paths.
		The main component in FCN-DenseNet is the dense block. 
		The dense block is constructed from a varying number of convolutional layers. 
		The purpose of the dense block is to concatenate feature maps of a layer with its output to emphasize spatial details information.
		
		The idea of PSPNet is to provide adequate global contextual information for pixel-level scene parsing by concatenating the local and global features together. 
		Hence, a spatial pyramid pooling module was introduced to perform four different pooling levels with four different pool sizes. 
		In this way, the pyramid pooling module can capture contextual features at different scales.
		
		GCN addresses the importance of having large kernels at the convolution operations for both localization and classification tasks for semantic segmentation.

	\note{
		The autoencoder ConvLSTM was trained on a sequence of consecutive full wavefield frames.
		
		Hence, for the synthetic dataset, the delamination location is known, I only utilised 24 frames after the interaction with the damage for training the model.
		
		Those selected frames containing the required features about the delamination shape and location are fed into an encoder-decoder model at once using a time-distributed layer.
		
		Then, the output of the decoder was forwarded into the ConvLSTM layer to learn the long-term spatiotemporal features.
		
		
		Now, for real-life situations where the damage location is not known, the figure on the left illustrates the complete procedure of obtaining intermediate predictions for the testing cases and finally calculating the RMS image.
		
		Accordingly, the window slides over all the input frames with a shift of one frame at a time.
		
		Then, an RMS of all the intermediate predictions is calculated to produce a damage map.

		This slide shows the three numerical test cases evaluated with the GCN model.
		
		For the first case, the delamination is barely visible by the naked eye, yet the model could identify the delamination with IOU= 0.71.
		
		For the second case, the IOU = 0.72, and for the third case, the IOU = .86.

%		As shown, the models are capable of precise detection and localisation of the delamination. 
%		We can see that the models can identify the delamination with almost free noise indicating the models are capable of generalising and detecting the delamination on previously unseen data.

	\note{
		Scanning laser Doppler vibrometer is a popular tool for the acquisition of the full wavefield of propagating guided waves, in particular Lamb waves.
		
		However, the process of acquiring the full wavefield of guided waves is time-consuming. 
		
		One possible solution to tackle this problem is to acquire the Lamb waves in a low-resolution form and then apply a deep learning-based super-resolution approach to that low-resolution frame of full wavefield data to retrieve the high-resolution frame.

	\begin{frame}{Evaluation metrics for SR model}
		For evaluating the reconstructed full wavefield
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR):
			\begin{equation*}
				PSNR=20\log_{10}\left(\frac{R}{\sqrt{MSE}}\right)
				\label{PSNR_}
			\end{equation*}
			\item Pearson correlation coefficient:
			\begin{equation*}
				r_{xy} = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n}(x_i - \bar{x})(y_i-\bar{y})}{\sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^{n}(x_i - \bar{x})^2}\sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^{n}(y_i - \bar{y})^2}}
				\label{Pearson_}
			\end{equation*}
		\end{itemize}
	\end{frame}
	%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
	\note{
		To evaluate the developed model, I used two metrics:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item The first one is the peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR), which refers to the maximum possible power of a signal and the power of the distorting noise that affects the quality of its representation.
%			This equation depicts the mathematical representation of PSNR, where R is the maximum fluctuation value in the input image, and MSE is the mean squared error between the actual and predicted output.
%			
			\item The second metric is the Pearson correlation coefficient (Pearson CC), which measures the linear relationship between two
			variable sets \(X\) (represents the ground truth values) and \(Y\) (represents the predicted values) as shown in the below equation.
			
%			Where \(n\) is the number of sample points,\(x_i, y_i\) are the individual value points representing the ground truth and predicted values, respectively, and \(\bar{x}\) and \(\bar{y}\) are the mean values of the sample and the prediction.

		In this slide, I present an experimental test case, in which the Low-resolution input data was registered by an SLDV at a uniform gird of \(32\times 32\) points.
		The LR input frame corresponds to the initial interaction with the delamination at frame number 110.
		
		Additionally, the conventional compressive sensing technique was applied as a reference with a various number of points used for the reconstruction of the wavefield. 
		
		Moreover, two types of masks (sub-sampling schemes) for the construction of measurement matrix were tested, namely random mask and jitter mask.
		
		Figure a shows the actual HR reference frame, and figures c, d, and e show reconstructed HR frames with the CS method at \(N_p = 1024\), \(N_p = 3000\) and \(N_p = 4000\) points, respectively. 
		
		As expected, when decreasing the \(N_p\) measuring points, the CS method is not able to recover HR frames accurately. 
		
		Figure f presents the reconstructed HR frame with the DLSR model. 
		
		Furthermore, figure g presents the reference region of interest we are attempting to recover, which shows reflected waves from damage.
		
		Figures h, i, and j show a poor reconstruction of the reflected waves at \(N_p = 1024\) and \(N_ = 3000\), respectively, using the CS method.
		
		Figure j shows the recovery of the reflected frames at \(N_p = 4000\) using the CS method, in which the reflected waves are recognisable.
		
		Figure k shows the recovery of the reflected waves using the DLSR model.
		The recovered reflected waves from damage is visible, and can be easily recognised, which indicates that the DLSR approach can be more efficient than the conventional CS method.

	%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
	\begin{frame}{Conclusions}		
		\begin{footnotesize}
			\begin{itemize}
				\item Full wavefields contain rich damage-related information, which can be utilised to train deep learning models to perform damage identification.
				\item Deep learning models trained on synthetic dataset generalise well and can be applied directly to experimental wavefields.				
				\item Animation-based deep learning models perform better than image-based models but are more complex and require longer time for training.
				\item The DLSR model can recover the HR measurements from LR measurements with high accuracy.
			\end{itemize}
		\begin{tcolorbox}
			\textbf{According to my research study, investigations and results, I can confirm my original thesis:}
			\begin{alertblock}{Thesis: 1}
				It is possible to use an end-to-end approach in which DNN 
				processes the animation of propagating waves (input) directly into a damage map (output).
			\end{alertblock}
			\begin{alertblock}{Thesis: 2}
				It is possible to speed up the data acquisition process by SLDV by employing an appropriate DL approach to recover high-resolution (HR) full wavefield scans  from a low-resolution (LR).
