	\note{
		Composite laminates have a wide range of applications in various industries due to their characteristics, such as high strength, low density, and resistance to fatigue and corrosion, among others.
		
		However, defects such as cracks, fibre breakage, and debonding can occur in composite laminates. 
		
		In particular, laminated composite materials are more sensitive to damage in the form of delamination due to weak transverse tensile and interlaminar shear strengths.
		
		Delaminations can seriously decrease the performance of composite structures.
		Accordingly, delamination detection in its early stages can significantly help to avoid catastrophic structural collapses.

	\note{
		The main objective of this work is to develop an artificial intelligence-based diagnostic system for the detection of delaminations in composite laminates.
		
		Therefore, I investigated the possibility of embracing the end-to-end approach by using animations of Lamb wave propagation in a plate interacting with discontinuities such as damage and edges with an artificial intelligence-based approach to detect and identify delaminations.
		
		My second objective is to address the issue of slow data acquisition of high-resolution full wavefields of Lamb wave propagation by SLDV.

			Structural health monitoring is about monitoring a structure periodically or continuously to evaluate its technical conditions.

			In this way, structural health monitoring mimics the human nervous system, which can provide us with real-time readings and detect any abnormal events.
			
			Accordingly, this is the ultimate aim of SHM: to monitor in real-time in a way that can detect damage early so we can perform preventive measures to protect the structure.

			Many conventional methods have been used for a long time in the industry for damage inspection, such as visual inspection, Eddy current, dye penetration, acoustic emission, and local ultrasonic testing.
			For the local ultrasonic testing, the frequency is in the range of 2 MHz–200 MHz, and the wavelength is way smaller than the thickness of the structure.
			There are different methods for ultrasonic testing, such as:
			pulse echo, in which we have a probe that generates ultrasonic waves that propagate through the thickness of a structure, and then the reflected waves from the bottom surface are captured by the same probe.
			The other ultrasonic method is called the "through-transmission method."
			There are two probes: one for transmitting on one side and the other for receiving on the other side.
			As a result, these methods are local, but they have some drawbacks:
			Labor-intensive, time-consuming, professional, and experienced personnel are required; complex structures may need to be disassembled.
			On the other hand, guided wave testing is a promising global NDE solution for SHM.
			The typical frequency range of guided waves is 10 kHz to 1 MHz, and their wavelength is larger than the thickness of the investigated structure.
			Guided waves can be generated using a piezoelectric actuator and registered by an array of piezoelectric sensors. 
			Alternatively, the propagation of guided Lamb waves can be registered using a scanning laser Doppler vibrometer to produce a full wavefield scan.

	\note{
		We now reach an essential concept: computer vision. 
		Computer vision is a subcategory of artificial intelligence that enables computers to obtain meaningful information from visual inputs.
		
		Computer vision has three hierarchical levels: 
		
		The first level performs a classification for the whole input and predicts one output.
		
		The second level classifies and locates the object that we are looking for. 
		
		The ultimate level of computer vision is to perform Pixel-wise segmentation (or semantic segmentation), in which each pixel in the input image is classified into its corresponding class.	
		
		I am using pixel wise image segmentation in my PhD work.

	\note{
		In this slide, I present a comparison between conventional machine learning and deep learning approaches to damage detection.
		
		In the conventional approaches, two processes must be performed: 
		The first is to extract the useful features from the registered data and then use a proper classification technique.
		
		This approach has several drawbacks:
		First, it requires a great amount of human labor and computational effort
		Secondly, it demands a high amount of experience from the practitioner.
		And lastly, when dealing with big data, it tends to be Inefficient as it requires a complex computation of damage features extraction and classification.
		
		On the other hand, the deep learning approach offers the opportunity to develop models that can automatically perform feature extraction and classification by themselves without human intervention in an end-to-end approach.

		To train the supervised deep learning models, a synthetic dataset of propagating waves in carbon fibre-reinforced composite plates was computed by applying the Mindlin-Reissner plate theory and using the parallel implementation of the time domain spectral element method.
		
		For each case, single delamination was modeled by using the method of splitting nodes between appropriate spectral elements.
		
		Essentially, the dataset resembles the particle velocity measurements at the bottom surface of the plate acquired by the SLDV in the transverse direction as a response to the piezoelectric (PZT) excitation at the centre of the plate.

		Accordingly, two main approaches were adopted:	
		\begin{itemize}
			\item One-to-one approach (takes one input (RMS image) and produces one output of damage map)
			\item Many-to-one approach (takes animation of Lamb waves propagation as a sequence of frames and produces one output as damage map).

		The autoencoder ConvLSTM was trained on a sequence of consecutive full wavefield frames.
		
		Hence, for the synthetic dataset, the delamination location is known, I only utilised 24 frames after the interaction with the damage for training the model.
		
		Those selected frames containing the required features about the delamination shape and location are fed into an encoder-decoder model at once using a time-distributed layer.
		
		Then, the output of the decoder was forwarded into the ConvLSTM layer to learn the long-term spatiotemporal features.
		
		
		Now, for real-life situations where the damage location is not known, the figure on the left illustrates the complete procedure of obtaining intermediate predictions for the testing cases and finally calculating the RMS image.
		
		Accordingly, the window slides over all the input frames with a shift of one frame at a time.
		
		Then, an RMS of all the intermediate predictions is calculated to produce a damage map.

		Specimens with multiple delaminations are shown on the left.
		
		In Specimen II, three large artificial delaminations of elliptic shape were inserted in the upper thickness quarter of the plate between the 4th and the 5th layer. 
		The delaminations were located at the same distance, equal to 150 mm from the centre of the plate. 
		
		In specimen III, delaminations were inserted in the middle of the cross-section of the plate between the 8th layer and the 9th layer.
		For Specimen IV, three small delaminations were inserted in the upper quarter of the cross-section of the plate, and three large delaminations were inserted at the lower quarter of the cross-section of the plate between the 12th layer and 13th layer. 
		
		The fifth specimen on the right has a single delamination. 
		The delamination between layers of the fabric was created artificially by a Teflon insert of a thickness 250 \(\mu\)m. 
		The Teflon of a square shape was inserted during specimen manufacturing, so its shape and location are known.
		
		Furthermore, all SLDV measurements were conducted from the bottom surface of the plate.
		
		I would like to mention that the specimens on the left were brought specifically to my PhD project.

		\tiny
		The theory of compressed sensing (CS) states that natural signals (such as sounds and images) can be recovered using considerably fewer samples or measurements (below the Nyquist sampling rate) than standard methods.
		
		Now, CS relies on two essential conditions: 	
		\begin{itemize}
			\item The first one is Sparsity: which means that(\alert{most of the coefficients in vector \(s\) are equal or close to zero}).
			$\Psi$ represent a universal basis such as Fourier, cosine or wavelet domains.
			In this work the Fourier domain was applied. 
			\item The second one is that the measuring mask C matrix must be incoherent with \(\Psi\) matrix, which means the correlation between any two elements in C and $\Psi$ matrices is small.
		\end{itemize}		
		
		regarding to this equation: 
		\begin{equation}
			y = \bs{C}\bs{\Psi}\bs{s}
		\end{equation}
		There are an infinite number of solutions for the sparse vector (s) that can solve the y vector.
		
		However, we need to find the sparsest s vector.
		
		Therefore, it is an optimization problem that can be solved by minimizing the \(L_1\) norm of s such that \(L_2\) norm \(\bs{C}\bs{\Psi}\bs{s}\)-\(\bs{y}\) equals zero, or some noise $\sigma$.
		
		Now that we have this sparsest vector (s), we can use the inverse Fourier transform to recover the high-resolution signal.

		In this slide, I present an experimental test case, in which the Low-resolution input data was registered by an SLDV at a uniform gird of  \(32\times 32\) points.
		The LR input frame corresponds to the initial interaction with the delamination at frame number 110.
		
		Additionally, the conventional compressive sensing technique was applied as a reference with a various number of points used for the reconstruction of the wavefield. 
		
		Moreover, two types of masks (sub-sampling schemes) for the construction of measurement matrix were tested, namely random mask and jitter mask.
		
		Figure a shows the actual HR reference frame, and figures c, d, and e  show reconstructed HR frames with the CS method at \(N_p = 1024\), \(N_p = 3000\) and \(N_p = 4000\) points, respectively. 
		
		As expected, when decreasing the \(N_p\) measuring points, the CS method is not able to recover HR frames accurately. 
		
		Figure f presents the reconstructed HR frame with the DLSR model. 
		
		Furthermore, figure g presents the reference region of interest we are attempting to recover, which shows reflected waves from damage.
		
		Figures h, i, and j show a poor reconstruction of the reflected waves at \(N_p = 1024\) and \(N_ = 3000\), respectively, using the CS method.
		
		Figure j shows the recovery of the reflected frames at \(N_p = 4000\) using the CS method, in which the reflected waves are recognisable.
		
		Figure k shows the recovery of the reflected waves using the DLSR model.
		The recovered reflected waves from damage is visible, and can be easily recognised, which indicates that the DLSR approach can be more efficient than the conventional CS method.

		It should be underlined, that for the number of points = 1024 points, the CS recovery algorithm behaves poorly at the delamination region, whereas the DLSR model is still able to achieve high PSNR and Pearson CC values.

	\note{			
		In this work, I used the supervised approach, which means that the input data is labelled.
		
		Accordingly, the idea of supervised learning is to learn a model of how to map the inputs to the outputs.
		
		Initially, when we start training the deep learning model, all learnable parameters, such as weights and biases, start with random values.
		These learnable parameters are updated during the training phase.
		Now, in the forward pass, we feed the data into the model, and it flows through the layers until we get the predicted output.
		Here, we need an objective loss function to estimate the loss (error) between the predicted output and the ground truth.
		
		A well-known optimization algorithm is a gradient descent, which aims to reduce the loss at each step to reach the global minimum value by calculating the gradient and then pushing back the calculated gradients across all the neurons in a technique called backpropagation.
		
		Accordingly, all learnable parameters are updated, which leads to minimizing the loss value.

		\begin{itemize}
			\item The input signal was a five-cycle Hann window modulated sinusoidal tone burst. 
			\item The carrier frequency was assumed to be 50 kHz. 
			\item The total wave propagation time was set to 0.75 ms so that the guided wave could propagate to the plate edges and back to the actuator twice. 
			\item The number of time integration steps was 150000, which was selected for the stability of the central difference scheme.
			\item The material was a typical cross-ply CFRP laminate. 
			\item The stacking sequence \([0/90]_4\) was used in the model. 
			\item The properties of a single ply were as follows [GPa]: \(C_{11}=52.55,\ C_{12}=6.51,\ C_{22}=51.83,\ C_{44}=2.93,\ C_{55}=2.92,\ C_{66}=3.81\). 
			\item The assumed mass density was 1522.4 kg/\(m^3\). 
			\item These properties were selected so that wave front patterns and wavelengths simulated numerically are similar to the wavefields measured by the SLDV on CFRP specimens used later on for testing the developed methods for delamination identification. 
			\item The shortest wavelength of the propagating A0 Lamb wave mode was 21.2 mm for numerical simulations and 19.5 mm for experimental measurements, respectively.

		\noindent Composite materials have their micro-structure designed in terms of their macroscopic constituents, e.g., fibers in a homogeneous matrix material. 
		By controlling the choice of fibres, their volume fraction, and alignment, the mechanical properties may be tailored to meet specific design requirements.
		\begin{columns}[T]				
			\begin{column}{0.45\textwidth}
				Diagram (a) shows a 'uniaxial fibre-reinforced composite material," and (b) shows how the stress on the composite is carried by the fibres and the matrix. 
				In normal situations, the fibre has a larger Young's modulus than the matrix, and for the continuous fibres shown, where the strain is the same in the matrix and the fibre, the fibre stress is higher than the matrix stress.

		The Young's modulus of the composite is given by the 'rule of mixtures' i.e. \(E_C = E_F V_F + E_MV_M\), also \((V_M + V_F) = 1\) or \(V_M = (1 - V_F )\). 
		The elastic modulus along the fibre direction can be controlled by selecting the volume fraction of the fibres.

			\item The total wave propagation time was set to \(0.75\) ms so that the guided wave could propagate to the plate edges and back to the actuator twice.
			\item The total time of propagation was converted into \(512\) frames of animated Lamb waves.
			\item The calculated group velocity of \(A_0\) mode is about \(1100\ m/s\).
			\item The \((x, y)\) coordinates of the center of the delaminations are known for the numerically generated dataset. 
			Therefore, we can calculate the distance between the center of the plate and the center of the delamination.
			\item As the group velocity of \(A_0\) mode is known, and the distance is known, we can calculate the required time for the propagating wave to reach the center of the delamination. 
		\end{itemize}
		
		When the time of interaction \(t_i\) with the delamination is know, we can approximately convert it to the frame number \(f_n\) as depicted in the equations given below:		
		\begin{gather*}
			t_i = \frac{\sqrt{(x-0.25)^2 +(y-0.25)^2} \ m}{1100\ m/s}

	\begin{frame}{Compressive sensing theory}
		\tiny
		A signal $\vec{s}\in \mathbb{R}^n$ can be reconstructed from a linear combination of random measurements $\vec{y} \in \mathbb{R}^m$.
		The general under-sampling problem can be written as:
		\begin{equation}
			\vec{y} = \bs{\Phi} \vec{s},
		\end{equation}
		where $\bs{\Phi} \in \mathbb{R}^{m\times n}$ is the measurement matrix and $m$ is the number of measurements which can be much smaller than the number of samples in the signal ($m<<n$).
		
		The signal $\vec{s}$ can be recovered from the compressed measurements $\vec{y}$, if it has sparse representation in some model basis $\bs{\Psi} \in \mathbb{R}^{n\times n}$, which can be written as:
		\begin{equation}
			\vec{s} = \bs{\Psi} \bs{\alpha},
		\end{equation}
		where $\bs{\alpha}$ has $K$ nonzero elements ($K<m<n$) and signal $\vec{s}$ is called $K$-sparse. 
		Moreover, the measurement matrix $\bs{\Phi}$ has to be incoherent with the model basis $\bs{\Psi}$.
		In practical applications, signals contain noise, hence:
		\begin{equation}
			\vec{y} = \bs{\Phi} \bs{\Psi} \bs{\alpha} + \vec{z},
			\label{eq:cs_with_noise}
		\end{equation}
		where $\vec{z}$ represents noise.
		The recovery problem can be solved by the basis pursuit denoising algorithm by relaxing Eq.~(\ref{eq:cs_with_noise}) and using sparsity promoting $L_1$ norm which can be written as:
		\begin{equation}
			\min{\lVert \tilde{\bs{\alpha}} \rVert}_1 \quad \textrm{subject to} \quad {\lVert \bs{\Phi} \bs{\Psi} \tilde{\bs{\alpha}} -\vec{y} \rVert}_2 \leq \sigma ,
		\end{equation}
		where $\sigma$ is related to the noise level in the data.
		
		In particular, in this paper we employed SPGL1 and Fourier basis.
		
		It should be added that the subsampling is performed only in the spatial domain, because in practice during SLDV measurements the time domain sampling frequency is fixed and cannot be altered in the acquisition software.

				The maximum permissible distance between grid points according to Nyquist theorem is calculated as in Eqn.~(\ref{eq:dx}):
				\begin{equation}
					d_{max}= \frac{1}{2*k_{max}} = \frac{1}{2*51.28\ [\textup{m}]} = \frac{\lambda}{2} = \frac{19.5}{2}\ \textup{[mm]}.
					\label{eq:dx}	
				\end{equation} 
				where $k_{max}$ is the maximum wavenumber, and $\lambda$ is the shortest wavelength.
				
				On the other hand, the longest distance between grid points on uniform square grid in 2D space is along the diagonal as shown in Figure below.
				Therefore, the number of Nyquist sampling points along edges of the plate is defined as:
				\begin{align}
					\begin{split}
						N_x= \frac{L}{d_{max}/\sqrt{2}}, \\
						N_y=  \frac{W}{d_{max}/\sqrt{2}},
					\end{split}
					\label{eq:Nyq}
				\end{align}
				where $L$ is the plate length, and $W$ is the plate width.
				
				In our particular case, $L=W=500$~[mm], and number of Nyquist points $N_x= N_y= N_{Nyq} =73$.

				In this work, we have generated a low-resolution training set with a frame size \((32\times32)\) pixels, which is below the Nyquist sampling rate of a 2D frame.
				Hence, we have performed image subsampling with bi-cubic interpolation and a uniform mesh of size \((32\times32)\) pixels with a compression rate (CR) of \(19.2\%\) from the Nyquist sampling rate as depicted in Eqn.~\ref{CR}:
				\begin{equation}
					CR = \frac{(Low-resolution\ dimension)^2}{(Nyquist\ sampling\ rate)^2} = \frac{(32\times32)}{(73\times73)}=19.2\%
					\label{CR}
