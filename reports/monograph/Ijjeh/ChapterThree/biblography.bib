abstract = {This paper presents a feasibility study on using Lamb waves to detect and locate through-width delamination in fiber-reinforced plastic beams. An active diagnostic system is proposed for clamped-free specimens. It consists of a piezoelectric patch and an accelerometer both mounted near the support. Such a system can locate damage in an absolute sense, that is, a priori knowledge on the response from pristine specimens is not required. The fundamental anti-symmetric Lamb wave mode is chosen as the diagnostic wave. It is generated by applying a voltage in the form of sinusoidal bursts to the piezoelectric patch. The proposed system was applied to locate delaminations in some fabricated Kevlar/epoxy beam specimens. With an appropriate actuating frequency, distortions of waveforms due to boundary reflections can be reduced. Based on their arrival times and the known propagating speed of Lamb waves, the delaminations can be located. The errors associated with the predicted damage positions range from 4.5% to 8.5%.},

abstract = {Composite materials are widely used in the industry, and the interest of this material is growing rapidly, due to its light weight, strength and various other desired mechanical properties. However, composite materials are prone to production defects and other defects originated during exploitation, which may jeopardize the safety of such a structure. Thus, non-destructive evaluation methods that are material-independent and suitable for a wide range of defects identification are needed. In this paper, a technique for damage characterization in composite plates is proposed. In the presented non-destructive testing method, guided waves are excited by a piezoelectric transducer, attached to tested specimens, and measured by a scanning laser Doppler vibrometer in a dense grid of points. By means of signal processing, irregularities in wavefield images caused by any material defects are extracted and used for damage characterization. The effectiveness of the proposed technique is validated on four different composite panels: Carbon fiber-reinforced polymer, glass fiber-reinforced polymer, composite reinforced by randomly-oriented short glass fibers and aluminum-honeycomb core sandwich composite. Obtained results confirm its versatility and efficacy in damage characterization in various types of composite plates.},

abstract = {Training Deep Neural Networks is complicated by the fact that the distribution of each layer's inputs changes during training, as the parameters of the previous layers change. This slows down the training by requiring lower learning rates and careful parameter initialization, and makes it notoriously hard to train models with saturating nonlinearities. We refer to this phenomenon as internal covariate shift, and address the problem by normalizing layer inputs. Our method draws its strength from making normalization a part of the model architecture and performing the normalization for each training mini-batch. Batch Normalization allows us to use much higher learning rates and be less careful about initialization, and in some cases eliminates the need for Dropout. Applied to a state-of-the-art image classification model, Batch Normalization achieves the same accuracy with 14 times fewer training steps, and beats the original model by a significant margin. Using an ensemble of batch-normalized networks, we improve upon the best published result on ImageNet classification: reaching 4.82% top-5 test error, exceeding the accuracy of human raters.},

An electromechanically coupled mathematical model is developed for the healthy and delaminated smart composite laminates, and their structural vibration responses are obtained in the time domain. Short Time Fourier Transform (STFT) is employed to transform the transient responses into two-dimensional spectral frame representation. A convolutional neural network is incorporated to distinguish between the damaged and undamaged states, as well as various types of damage of the laminated composites, by automatically extracting discriminative features from the vibration-based spectrograms. The CNN showed a classification accuracy of 90.1% on one healthy and 12 delaminated cases. The study of the confusion matrix of CNN provided further insights into the physics of the problem. The predictive performance of a pre-trained CNN classifier was also evaluated on unseen cases of delamination, and physically consistent results were obtained.},

We show that convolutional networks by themselves, trained end-to-end, pixels-to-pixels, improve on the previous best result in semantic segmentation. Our key insight is to build 'fully convolutional' networks that take input of arbitrary size and produce correspondingly-sized output with efficient inference and learning. We define and detail the space of fully convolutional networks, explain their application to spatially dense prediction tasks, and draw connections to prior models. We adapt contemporary classification networks (AlexNet, the VGG net, and GoogLeNet) into fully convolutional networks and transfer their learned representations by fine-tuning to the segmentation task. We then define a skip architecture that combines semantic information from a deep, coarse layer with appearance information from a shallow, fine layer to produce accurate and detailed segmentations. Our fully convolutional networks achieve improved segmentation of PASCAL VOC (30% relative improvement to 67.2% mean IU on 2012), NYUDv2, SIFT Flow, and PASCAL-Context, while inference takes one tenth of a second for a typical image.},

The wave propagation data are used to determine the location and degree of damage in metallic and composite plates. The structural components are to be instrumented with array of actuators and sensors (PCB) able to excite and record its dynamic response. A damage index, calculated from the measured wave propagation data in a reference state (baseline) and the current state, is introduced as a determinant of structural damage. The index is a relative measure comparing the two states of the structure under the same ambient conditions. The damage index increase its intensity when the damage size increase too. Moreover, its calculation in different paths associated with the Artificial Neural Networks or Probability Ellipse methods allow to identify position and entity of the damage. Two panels made by aluminum and fabric composite material have been used for tests. A damage entities simulated as through-thickness hole with diameter equal to 6. mm has been investigated for aluminium panel while three damage entities (through-thickness hole with size equal to 2.5. mm, 4.5. mm and 9. mm) have been investigated for that in composite material. In order to get a training, needful for the application of the ANN method, finite elements analysis have been performed for the aluminum panel taking into account several damage paths. Simulations have been performed in order to characterize the propagation path of the Lamb waves in composite plate changing the damage entities from hole diameter equal to 2.5. mm up to 9. mm. Damage index for each damage size for both simulations and tests will be compared. The potential applications of these methods in developing health monitoring systems in defects-critical structures and in composite material structures are discussed.},

abstract = {State-of-the-art approaches for semantic image segmentation are built on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The typical segmentation architecture is composed of (a) a downsampling path responsible for extracting coarse semantic features, followed by (b) an upsampling path trained to recover the input image resolution at the output of the model and, optionally, (c) a post-processing module (e.g. Conditional Random Fields) to refine the model predictions. Recently, a new CNN architecture, Densely Connected Convolutional Networks (DenseNets), has shown excellent results on image classification tasks. The idea of DenseNets is based on the observation that if each layer is directly connected to every other layer in a feed-forward fashion then the network will be more accurate and easier to train. In this paper, we extend DenseNets to deal with the problem of semantic segmentation. We achieve state-of-the-art results on urban scene benchmark datasets such as CamVid and Gatech, without any further post-processing module nor pretraining. Moreover, due to smart construction of the model, our approach has much less parameters than currently published best entries for these datasets.},

abstract = {Delaminations in composite laminates resulting from impact events may be accompanied by minimal indication of damage at the surface. As such, inspections are required to ensure defects are within allowable limits. Conventional ultrasonic scanning techniques have been shown to effectively characterize the size and depth of delaminations but require physical contact with the structure and considerable setup time. Alternatively, a non-contact scanning laser vibrometer may be used to measure guided wave propagation in the laminate structure generated by permanently bonded transducers. A local Fourier domain analysis method is presented for processing guided wavefield data to estimate spatially dependent wavenumber values, which can be used to determine delamination depth. The technique is applied to simulated wavefields and results are analyzed to determine limitations of the technique with regards to determining defect size and depth. Based on simulation results, guidelines for application of the technique are developed. Finally, experimental wavefield data is obtained in quasi-isotropic carbon fiber reinforced polymer (CFRP) laminates with impact damage. The recorded wavefields are analyzed and wavenumber is measured to an accuracy of up to 8.5% in the region of shallow delaminations. These results show the promise of local wavenumber domain analysis to characterize the depth of delamination damage in composite laminates. The technique can find application in automated vehicle health assurance systems with potential for high detection rates and greatly reduced operator effort and setup time. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {In this study, a structural response recovery method using a convolutional neural network is proposed. The aim of this study is to restore missing strain structural responses when they cannot be collected due to a sensor fault, data loss, or communication errors. To this end, a convolutional neural network model for data recovery is constructed using the strain monitoring data stably measured before the occurrence of data loss. Under the assumption that specific sensors fail among the multiple sensors installed on a structure, the structural responses of these specific sensors are intentionally excluded and the remaining structural responses are set as the input data of the convolutional neural network. In addition, the intentionally excluded structural responses are set as the output data of the convolutional neural network. In case of a sensor fault, the trained convolutional neural network is used to recover the missing strain responses using functional sensors alone. The applicability of the proposed method is verified by a numerical study on a beam structure and an experimental study on a frame structure. The data recovery performance of the proposed convolutional neural network is discussed according to the number of failed sensors and the types of structural members with the failed sensors. Finally, the field applicability of the proposed method is examined using strain monitoring data measured from an overpass bridge in use over a long period of time.},

abstract = {This paper presents two algorithms, both based on the time of flight (ToF) of scattered waves, to locate defect in an anisotropic woven-fabric carbon fiber reinforced polymer (CFRP) plate. The first algorithm uses a probabilistic approach by constructing a probability matrix. Each element of this matrix is associated with a location and represents the probability of existing a defect at the corresponding spatial coordinates of the plate. For the probability matrix method, localization results are influenced by manually chosen parameters and by the anisotropy of the CFRP plate. The second algorithm, based on artificial neural networks (ANNs), enables us to improve the accuracy of locating defects. With this ANN method, the anisotropic feature can be "learned" by the neural network from training data. The ToF of scattered waves obtained from three sensor pairs were used directly as inputs of the neural network. The spatial coordinates of the defect are the ANN outputs. The difficulty of obtaining sufficient experimental data for ANN training was surpassed by using added blocks on the surface of the plate under test to simulate defects. This scheme was validated and proved to be effective by comparing the scattered waves from a delamination and from an added block. Conclusions have been drawn by comparing the two methods. The localization results obtained by the ANN algorithm are proved to be better.},

abstract = {Lamb wave based damage detection techniques have been widely used in composite structures. In particular, these techniques usually rely on reference signals, which are significantly influenced by the operational and environmental conditions. To solve this issue, this paper presents a baseline-free damage inspection method based on the reciprocity principle. If a localized nonlinear scatterer exists along the wave path, the reciprocity breaks down. Through estimating the loss of reciprocity, the delamination could be detected. A reciprocity index (RI), which compares the discrepancy between the signal received in transducer B when emitting from transducer A and the signal received in A when the same source is located in B, is established to quantitatively analyze the reciprocity. Experimental results show that the RI value of a damaged path is much higher than that of a healthy path. In addition, the effects of the parameters of excitation signal (i.e., central frequency and bandwidth) and the position of delamination on the RI value are discussed. Furthermore, a RI based probabilistic imaging algorithm is proposed for detecting delamination damage of composite plates without reference signals. Finally, the effectiveness of this baseline-free damage detection method is validated by an experimental example.},

abstract = {This paper presents the application of Lamb waves to inspect damage in composite laminates. The proposed methodology employs a network of transducers that are used to sequentially scan the structure before and after the presence of damage by transmitting and receiving Lamb wave pulses. A damage localization image is reconstructed by analyzing the cross-correlation of the scatter signal envelope with the excitation pulse envelope for each transducer pair. A potential damage area is then reconstructed by superimposing the image observed from each actuator and sensor signal path. Both numerical and experimental case studies are used to verify the proposed methodology for composite laminates. Three-dimensional finite element models with a transducer network consisting of four transducer elements are used in the numerical case studies. The experimental case studies employ a transducer network using four piezoelectric transducers as transmitter elements and a laser vibrometer to measure the response signals at four locations close to the transducers. The results show that the method enables the reliable detection of structural damage with locating inaccuracies of the order of a few millimeters inside as well as outside of an inspection area of 100 × 100mm2. {\textcopyright} 2009 IOP Publishing Ltd.},

The principal goal for SHM is oriented to the development of efficient methodologies to process these data and provide results associated with the different levels of the damage identification process. As a contribution, this work presents a damage detection and classification methodology which includes the use of data collected from a structure under different structural states by means of a piezoelectric sensor network taking advantage of the use of guided waves, hierarchical nonlinear principal component analysis (h-NLPCA), and machine learning. The methodology is evaluated and tested in two structures: (i) a carbon fibre reinforced polymer (CFRP) sandwich structure with some damages on the multilayered composite sandwich structure and (ii) a CFRP composite plate. Damages in the structures were intentionally produced to simulate different damage mechanisms, that is, delamination and cracking of the skin.},

abstract = {A fully non-contact laser-based nondestructive inspection (NDI) system is developed to detect and visualize damage in structures. The study focuses on the size quantification and characterization of a barely visible impact damage (BVID) in a honeycomb composite panel. The hardware consists of a Q-switched Nd:YAG pulse laser that probes the panel by generating broadband guided waves via thermo-elastic expansion. The laser, in combination with a set of galvano-mirrors is used to raster scan over a two-dimensional surface covering the damaged region of an impacted quasi-isotropic [60/0/−60]s honeycomb composite panel. The out-of-plane velocities are measured at a fixed location normal to the surface by a laser Doppler vibrometer (LDV). An ultrasonic full wavefield assembled from the three-dimensional space-time data matrix in the interrogated area is first acquired and then processed for imaging the impacted damage area. A wavenumber filtering technique in terms of wave vectors is applied to distinguish the forward and backward wavefields in the wavenumber-frequency domain. A zero-lag cross correlation (ZLCC) imaging condition is then employed in the space-frequency domain for damage imaging. The ZLCC imaging condition consists of cross correlating the incident and reflected wavefields in the entire scanned region. The condition not only images the damage boundary between incident and reflected waves outside the damage region but also, for longer time windows, enables to capture the momentary standing waves formed within the damaged region. The ZLCC imaging condition imaged two delaminated region: a main delamination, which was a skewed elliptic with major and minor axis lengths roughly 17 mm and 10 mm respectively, and a secondary delamination region approximately 6 mm by 4 mm, however, which can only be shown at higher frequency range around 80–95 kHz. To conclude, the ZLCC results were in very good agreement with ultrasonic C-scan and X-ray computed tomographic (X-ray CT) scan results. Since the imaging condition is performed in the space-frequency domain, the imaging from ZLCC can also reveal resonance modes which are shown in the main delaminated area by windowing a narrow frequency band sequentially.},

The first branch has the encoder-decoder architecture to encode the visual features and sequentially generate the output words as a command, while the second branch uses a Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN) to learn the fine-grained actions. By jointly training both branches, the network is able to model the sequential information of the command, while effectively encodes the fine-grained actions. The experimental results on our new large-scale dataset show that V2CNet outperforms recent state-of-the-art methods by a substantial margin, while its output can be applied in real robotic applications.

abstract = {The guided wave propagation and artificial intelligence (AI) approaches were used to propose an intelligent model for automatic detection and classification of the matrix cracking in composites. Glass/epoxy cross-ply laminated composites were fabricated and the matrix cracking with several densities was induced in 90° layers. A non-destructive testing procedure using the fundamental antisymmetric Lamb wave propagation was performed on the intact specimens and those with 0.05, 0.15, and 0.25 matrix cracking density. The velocity of propagated Lamb wave, wave amplitudes in four different distances from the actuator, and the ratio of these amplitudes to the first received wave amplitude, in three frequencies of 100, 200, and 330 kHz were extracted from the acquired signals. The extracted sensory features were used to train three types of supervised machine learning models for the crack density classification. The linear discriminant analysis (LDA) was performed for dimensional reduction to find a linear combination of features that can better discriminate the classes. Support vector machines (SVM), linear vector quantization (LVQ) neural network (NN), and multilayer perceptron (MLP) NN were used for the classification. It was shown that SVM accounted for the highest classification accuracy (91.7%) followed by LVQ NN (88.9%) and MLP NN (77.8%), respectively.},

abstract = {A novel full wavefield processing method by using fully convolutional neural networks is presented. The full wavefield of propagating Lamb waves in the fibre-reinforced composite plate was simulated by the parallel spectral element method. It resembles a full wavefield measurements acquired on a surface of the plate by the scanning laser Doppler vibrometer. The aim of the proposed technique is an identification of delamination location, size and shape. It is achieved by pixel-wise image segmentation by using the end-to-end approach. It is possible because of the large dataset of Lamb wave propagation patterns resulting from interaction with delaminations of random location, size and shape. It is demonstrated that the proposed method, tested on numerical data, is performing better than conventional adaptive wavenumber filtering method which was developed in previous work. Moreover, it enables better automation of delamination identification so that the damage map can be created without user intervention. The method was also tested on experimental data acquired on the surface of the specimen in which delamination was artificially created by a Teflon insert. The obtained results with the deep learning approach show its capability to predict the delamination in the numerically generated dataset with high accuracy compared to the conventional damage detection approach. Furthermore, the deep learning model shows the ability to generalize to a further experiential set.},

Image classification and bounding box approaches have been proposed in existing vision-based automated concrete crack detection methods using deep convolutional neural networks.

Performance of three different pre-trained network architectures, which serves as the FCN encoder's backbone, is evaluated for image classification on a public concrete crack dataset of 40,000 227 × 227 pixel images. Subsequently, the whole encoder-decoder FCN network with the VGG16-based encoder is trained end-to-end on a subset of 500 annotated 227 × 227-pixel crack-labeled images for semantic segmentation. The FCN network achieves about 90% in average precision. Images extracted from a video of a cyclic loading test on a concrete specimen are used to validate the proposed method for concrete crack detection. It was found that cracks are reasonably detected and crack density is also accurately evaluated.},

abstract = {Non-destructive testing and structural health monitoring (SHM) techniques using elastic guided waves are often limited by material inhomogeneity or geometrical irregularities of the tested parts. This is a severe restriction in many fields of engineering such as aerospace or aeronautics, where typically one needs to monitor composite structures with varying mechanical properties and complex geometries. This is particularly true in the case of multiscale composite materials, where anisotropy and material gradients may be present. Here, we provide an impact localization algorithm based on time reversal and laser vibrometry to cope with this type of complexity. The proposed approach is shown to be insensitive to local elastic wave velocity or geometrical features. The technique is based on the correlation of the measured impact response and a set of measured test data acquired at various grid points along the specimen surface, allowing high resolution in the determination of the impact point. We present both numerical finite element simulations and experimental measurements to support the proposed procedure, showing successful implementation on an eccentrically stiffened aluminum plate. The technique holds promise for advanced SHM, potentially in real time, of geometrically complex composite structures.},

Empirical results demonstrate that Adam works well in practice and compares favorably to other stochastic optimization methods.

The SHM methodology herein discussed, denoted as D2-DTE, is based on decision trees ensemble and belongs to the class of vibration-based approaches, being the health assessment of the structure obtained by analyzing dynamic properties of the structural system, namely, mode shapes and natural frequencies. The proposed damage detection method is validated for three different test cases, including both numerical simulations and experimentally recorded data, which consider a wide array of damage configurations, including single and multiple damages; different damage types and severities; and the presence of random noise levels associated with dynamic properties acquisition. The performances of the D2-DTE are evaluated in terms of accuracy, confidence of probabilistic predictions, and measurements of physical distances in localization errors. Additionally, two of the investigated test cases are based on available benchmarks, thus allowing a direct comparison with a state-of-the-art methodology.

abstract = {The tomography technique is an effective way to quantitatively evaluate damage from reconstruction imaging in structure health monitoring (SHM). The reconstruction algorithm for the probabilistic inspection of damage (RAPID) algorithm based on the signal difference coefficient (SDC) feature is a promising approach due to its superior performance. This paper focuses on the influence of different patterns of PZT (Lead Zirconate Titanate) sensor array configurations, i.e., the circular, square, and parallel array, on reconstruction image qualities for evaluating hole and crack damage. Variable shape parameters are applied to account for the unequal damage distances of different actuator-sensor pairs. Considering the directionality scattering fields of cracks, the angular scattering pattern of the SDC values are studied by simulation. The SDC variations for different groups of sensing paths at the same actuator are applied to predict the crack orientation. An improved RAPID algorithm is proposed by defining an additional SDC value of 1 in the path along the predicted crack orientation, which is determined by the point of the actuator causing the minimal SDC variation and the center point of the initial reconstruction image of the crack. The results show that the improved RAPID algorithm is effective for the evaluation of crack damage. Reconstruction image qualities with three PZT sensor array configurations for both holes and cracks are compared. The research is significant for selecting the PZT sensor array configuration in SHM.},

abstract = {Ultrasonic Lamb waves offer an attractive method of damage detection in composite aerospace structures. However, in order to utilise these waves fully a basic understanding of their propagation in composites is required. The propagation of Lamb waves in composites is complicated by the anisotropic lay-up which can lead to the speed of the Lamb mode being dependent on the laminate lay-up and the direction of wave propagation. This study concentrated on the fundamental symmetric mode, S0, and the fundamental anti-symmetric mode, A0. A one-dimensional finite-element model has been developed to solve for Lamb wave solutions in anisotropic layered structures. The calculated dispersion curves for various composite lay-ups are presented together with plots of the through-thickness particle and stress component amplitudes.

The database of images used in this study, containing potato tubers of different cultivars, sizes, and diseases, was acquired, classified, and labeled manually by experts. The models were trained over different train-test splits to better understand the amount of image data needed to apply deep learning for such classification tasks. The models were tested over a data set of images taken using standard low-cost RGB (red, green, and blue) sensors and were tagged by experts, demonstrating high classification accuracy. This is the first article to report the successful implementation of deep convolutional networks, popular in object identification, to the task of disease identification in potato tubers, showing the potential of deep learning techniques in agricultural tasks.},

abstract = {Composite materials have become extremely important for several engineering applications due to their superior mechanical properties. However, a major challenge in the use of composites is to detect, locate and quantify fatigue induced damage, particularly delamination, by using limited experimental data. The use of guided Lamb wave based health monitoring with embedded sensors has emerged as a potential solution to effectively predict delamination size. To do this, machine learning prediction models have been used in the past, however, a transfer learning approach which can address the problem of inadequate labeled data by allowing the use of a pretrained model for predicting damage in a new composite specimen, has not been explored in this field. This paper proposes a temporal convolutional network (TCN) based transfer learning (TCN-trans) scheme for predicting delamination damage using sensor measurements. The application of proposed framework is demonstrated on Lamb wave sensor dataset collected from fatigue experiments measuring the evolution of damage in carbon fiber reinforced polymer (CFRP) cross-ply laminates. The results show that TCN-trans yields better damage prediction by fine-tuning a pretrained model with a small number of test specimen samples as compared to a TCN trained only on the test specimen data.},

This paper proposes the use of the value of information and the relative expected information gain as optimality criteria to determine the best number and positions of sensors, respectively. The proposed methodology is general, but in this paper it is specialized for ultrasonic guided-wave optimal system configuration. Two case studies are used to illustrate the suitability of the proposed methodology in providing the optimal sensor configuration of an ultrasonic guided-wave based structural health monitoring system. The results confirm the value of information as an efficient and rational index to compare among different sensor positioning strategies, while accounting for the underlying modeling and measurement uncertainties. As key contribution, a novel framework that trades-off between amount and cost of information is provided. The results show that geometrically unconstrained sensor configurations are preferred, since they provide a healthier balance between the amount of information and the benefit of such information.},

The implementation is realised by using Matlab Parallel Computing Toolbox and optimized for Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) computation. In this way, considerable computation speed-up can be achieved in comparison to computation on conventional processors. The implementation includes an interpolation of wavefield on a uniform grid. The method was tested on experimental data set available on the Open Guided Waves platform. The qualitative comparison was performed on full wavefield data, whereas quantitative comparison was made directly on signals of propagating Lamb waves registered by piezoelectric transducers. In both cases, good agreement between numerical and experimental results was achieved. The proposed method is particularly useful for structural health monitoring algorithms in which signal parameters are required such as wave velocity dependence on the angle of propagation. Moreover, it enables model-assisted damage size estimation in which the damage influence curve is estimated based on large numerical data sets and sparse experimental data. Due to relatively short computation times, large data sets can be generated and used for machine learning or other soft computing methods opening up new possibilities in health monitoring of metallic and composite structures.},

This study was conducted to identify the long-haul travel motivation by international tourists to Penang. A total of 400 respondents participated in this survey, conducted around the tourist attractions in Penang, using cluster random sampling. However, only 370 questionnaires were only used for this research. Data were analysed using SPSS software 22 version. The findings, ‘knowledge and novelty seeking' were the main push factors that drove long-haul travel by international tourists to Penang. Meanwhile, the main pull factor that attracts long- haul travel by international tourists to Penang was its ‘culture and history'. Additionally, there were partly direct and significant relationships between socio-demographic, trip characteristics and travel motivation (push factors and pull factors). Overall, this study identified the long-haul travel motivations by international tourists to Penang based on socio-demographic, trip characteristics and travel motivation and has indirectly helped in understanding the long-haul travel market particularly for Penang and Southeast Asia. This research also suggested for an effective marketing and promotion strategy in pro- viding useful information that is the key to attract international tourists to travel long distances.

Recent years have seen an increasing focus on methods that are specific to damage identification, with the maximisation of correct classification outcomes being prioritised. The objectives of this article are to present the SPO for SHM problem, to provide an overview of the current state of the art in this area, and to identify promising emergent trends within the literature. The key conclusions drawn are that there remains a great deal of scope for research in a number of key areas, including the development of methods that promote robustness to modelling uncertainty, benign effects within measured data, and failures within the sensor network. There also remains a paucity of studies that demonstrate practical, experimental evaluation of developed SHM system designs. Finally, it is argued that the pursuit of novel or highly efficient optimisation methods may be considered to be of secondary importance in an SPO context, given that the optimisation effort is expended at the design stage.},

abstract = {Delamination, i.e. the separation between layers that occurs by failure of the resin-rich interlaminar interface, is a direct consequence of the lack of out-of-plane reinforcements and, undoubtedly, the most common damage mode in laminated composites. Delaminations induced by low-velocity impacts are of primary concern in structural applications, since impact damage, often miss-detected, may propagate, impairing the load bearing capacity of the component, particularly under compressive loads. Preventing delamination, as well as delaying and limiting its propagation, are thus key issues in the design of composite structures. Over the last decades, many strategies have been proposed to address this problem. Among them, the introduction of through-thickness reinforcements (stitching, pinning and stapling) has proven to be effective in improving the interlaminar properties of composite materials. In particular, recent studies have shown that Z-pinning, which consists in inserting high stiffness pins through the thickness of uncured laminates, may significantly enhance the delamination resistance of laminated components. In this study, conventional and Z-pin reinforced [02/902]s graphite/epoxy laminates were subjected to low-velocity impact and compression after impact (CAI) tests in order to examine the effect of the reinforcements on the impact response and the residual post-impact properties of the laminate. The results show that Z-pinning significantly reduces the extent of delamination induced by impact, while, on the contrary, it appears to only marginally improve the post-impact compressive strength of the laminates.},

We explicitly reformulate the layers as learning residual functions with reference to the layer inputs, instead of learning unreferenced functions. We provide comprehensive empirical evidence showing that these residual networks are easier to optimize, and can gain accuracy from considerably increased depth. On the ImageNet dataset we evaluate residual nets with a depth of up to 152 layers - 8× deeper than VGG nets [40] but still having lower complexity. An ensemble of these residual nets achieves 3.57% error on the ImageNet test set. This result won the 1st place on the ILSVRC 2015 classification task. We also present analysis on CIFAR-10 with 100 and 1000 layers. The depth of representations is of central importance for many visual recognition tasks. Solely due to our extremely deep representations, we obtain a 28% relative improvement on the COCO object detection dataset.

abstract = {Statistical pattern recognition methodologies have gained considerable attention for Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) applications to detect changes in a structure (e.g. damage). For most of such applications, outlier analysis of the damage sensitive features obtained from the SHM data is used to detect the changes in the structure. There are a number of different approaches used by different research groups and it is widely accepted that success of a certain methodology may depend on the structure and/or structural change to be identified. Therefore, it is very important that promising methodologies are verified by using different test structures and damage cases. The main objective of this study is to investigate statistical pattern recognition methods in the context of SHM using different laboratory structures. Time series modeling, i.e. auto-regressive models, is used in conjunction with Mahalanobis distance-based outlier detection algorithms to identify different types of structural changes on different test structures. Similar approaches were reported in the literature but here the methodology is modified by using random decrement functions to eliminate the effects of the exogenous input. Then a number of tests are conducted by using two different test structures in laboratory conditions in order to evaluate the results in a comparable fashion. The first test specimen is a simply supported steel beam where the second structure is a highly redundant steel grid structure. Various damage conditions are simulated by using these structures. The ambient vibration data is analyzed by using the methodology described and results are presented. Finally, the advantages and drawbacks of the methodology are discussed in the light of experimental results. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The interaction of individual Lamb waves with a variety of defects simulated by notches has been investigated using finite-element analysis, the results being checked experimentally. Excellent agreement has been obtained between the numerical and experimental results and it has been shown that a two-dimensional (2-D) Fourier transform method that the authors have developed may be used to quantify Lamb wave interactions with defects in both experimental and numerical investigations. The results have shown that the sensitivity of individual Lamb waves to particular notches is dependent on the frequency-thickness product, the mode type (symmetric or antisymmetric), the mode order, and the geometry of the notch. The sensitivity of the Lamb modes a1, ao, and s0 to simulated defects in different frequency-thickness regions has been predicted as a function of the defect depth to plate thickness ratio (h/2d) and the results have indicated that Lamb waves may be used to find notches when the wavelength to notch depth ratio is of the order of 40. It has also been shown that provided the notch width is small compared to the wavelength, the transmission and reflection amplitudes are insensitive to changes in width, so the ratio of the depth of the notch to the plate thickness is the controlling parameter. Both the numerical and experimental results have shown that the transmission ratios of Lamb waves across defects are highly frequency dependent, particularly at higher frequency-thicknesses. The positions of the maxima and minima in the transmission curves are a function of notch depth that suggests that monitoring the change in transmission ratio with frequency may provide a means of defect sizing. {\textcopyright} 1992 IEEE},

abstract = {We present an augmented reality system for large scale 3D reconstruction and recognition in outdoor scenes. Unlike existing prior work, which tries to reconstruct scenes using active depth cameras, we use a purely passive stereo setup, allowing for outdoor use and extended sensing range. Our system not only produces a map of the 3D environment in real-time, it also allows the user to draw (or 'paint') with a laser pointer directly onto the reconstruction to segment the model into objects. Given these examples our system then learns to segment other parts of the 3D map during online acquisition. Unlike typical object recognition systems, ours therefore very much places the user 'in the loop' to segment particular objects of interest, rather than learning from predefined databases. The laser pointer additionally helps to 'clean up' the stereo reconstruction and final 3D map, interactively. Using our system, within minutes, a user can capture a full 3D map, segment it into objects of interest, and refine parts of the model during capture. We provide full technical details of our system to aid replication, as well as quantitative evaluation of system components. We demonstrate the possibility of using our system for helping the visually impaired navigate through spaces. Beyond this use, our system can be used for playing large-scale augmented reality games, shared online to augment streetview data, and used for more detailed car and person navigation.},

abstract = {Corrosion is a major defect in structural systems that has a significant economic impact and can pose safety risks if left untended. Currently, an inspector visually assesses the condition of a structure to identify corrosion. This approach is time-consuming, tedious, and subjective. Robotic systems, such as unmanned aerial vehicles, paired with computer vision algorithms have the potential to perform autonomous damage detection that can significantly decrease inspection time and lead to more frequent and objective inspections. This study evaluates the use of convolutional neural networks for corrosion detection. A convolutional neural network learns the appropriate classification features that in traditional algorithms were hand-engineered. Eliminating the need for dependence on prior knowledge and human effort in designing features is a major advantage of convolutional neural networks. This article presents different convolutional neural network–based approaches for corrosion assessment on metallic surfaces. The effect of different color spaces, sliding window sizes, and convolutional neural network architectures are discussed. To this end, the performance of two pretrained state-of-the-art convolutional neural network architectures as well as two proposed convolutional neural network architectures are evaluated, and it is shown that convolutional neural networks outperform state-of-the-art vision-based corrosion detection approaches that are developed based on texture and color analysis using a simple multilayered perceptron network. Furthermore, it is shown that one of the proposed convolutional neural networks significantly improves the computational time in contrast with state-of-the-art pretrained convolutional neural networks while maintaining comparable performance for corrosion detection.},

Many challenging computer vision tasks, such as detection, localization, recognition, and segmentation of objects in an unconstrained environment, are being efficiently addressed by various types of deep neural networks, such as convolutional neural networks, recurrent networks, adversarial networks, and autoencoders. Although there have been plenty of analytical studies regarding the object detection or recognition domain, many new deep learning techniques have surfaced with respect to image segmentation techniques. This article approaches these various deep learning techniques of image segmentation from an analytical perspective. The main goal of this work is to provide an intuitive understanding of the major techniques that have made a significant contribution to the image segmentation domain. Starting from some of the traditional image segmentation approaches, the article progresses by describing the effect that deep learning has had on the image segmentation domain. Thereafter, most of the major segmentation algorithms have been logically categorized with paragraphs dedicated to their unique contribution. With an ample amount of intuitive explanations, the reader is expected to have an improved ability to visualize the internal dynamics of these processes.},

abstract = {Damage diagnosis has been a challenging inverse problem in structural health monitoring. The main difficulty is characterizing the unknown relation between the measurements and damage patterns (i.e., damage indicator selection). Such damage indicators would ideally be able to identify the existence, location, and severity of damage. Therefore, this procedure requires complex data processing algorithms and dense sensor arrays, which brings computational intensity with it. To address this limitation, this paper introduces convolutional neural network (CNN), which is one of the major breakthroughs in image recognition, to the damage detection and localization problem. The CNN technique has the ability to discover abstract features and complex classifier boundaries that are able to distinguish various attributes of the problem. In this paper, a CNN topology was designed to classify simulated damaged and healthy cases and localize the damage when it exists. The performance of the proposed technique was evaluated through the finite-element simulations of undamaged and damaged structural connections. Samples were trained by using strain distributions as a consequence of various loads with several different crack scenarios. Completely new damage setups were introduced to the model during the testing process. Based on the findings of the proposed study, the damage diagnosis and localization were achieved with high accuracy, robustness, and computational efficiency.},

abstract = {Lamb wave based structural health monitoring shows a lot of potential for damage detection of composite structures. However, currently there is no agreement upon optimal network arrangement or detection algorithm. The objective of this research is to develop a sparse network that can be expanded to detect damage over a large area. To achieve this, a novel technique based on damage progression history has been developed. This technique gives an amplification factor to data along actuator-sensor paths that show a steady reduction in transmitted power as induced damage progresses and is implemented with the reconstruction algorithm for probabilistic inspection of damage (RAPID) technique. Two damage metrics are used with the algorithm and a comparison is made to the more commonly used signal difference coefficient (SDC) metric. Best case results show that damage is detected within 12 mm. The algorithm is also run on a more sparse network with no damage detection, therefore indicating that the selected arrangement is the most sparse arrangement with this configuration.

abstract = {Ultrasonic wavefield imaging with a non-contact technology can provide detailed information about the health status of an inspected structure. However, high spatial resolution, often necessary for accurate damage quantification, typically demands a long scanning time. In this work, we investigate a novel methodology to acquire high-resolution wavefields with a reduced number of measurement points to minimize the acquisition time. Such methodology is based on the combination of compressive sensing and convolutional neural networks to recover high spatial frequency information from low-resolution images. A data set was built from 652 wavefield images acquired with a laser Doppler vibrometer describing guided ultrasonic wave propagation in eight different structures, with and without various simulated defects. Out of those 652 images, 326 cases without defect and 326 cases with defect were used as a training database for the convolutional neural network. In addition, 273 wavefield images were used as a testing database to validate the proposed methodology. For quantitative evaluation, two image quality metrics were calculated and compared to those achieved with different recovery methods or by training the convolutional neural network with non-wavefield images data set. The results demonstrate the capability of the technique for enhancing image resolution and quality, as well as similarity to the wavefield acquired on the full high-resolution grid of scan points, while reducing the number of measurement points down to 10% of the number of scan points for a full grid.},

A new set of damage features and their implementation for damage detection and quantification are discussed in this article. These features are the autoregressive and exogenous coefficients in a frequency domain data model and can be used to distinguish between linear and nonlinear types of damage. In this work, autoregressive coefficients are used to characterize nonlinear damage and exogenous coefficients are used to characterize linear damage states. The ability to distinguish between linear and nonlinear types of damage and healthy system nonlinearities is critical when diagnosing structural health because damage initiation and growth are fundamentally nonlinear processes. It is shown that absolute damage severity can sometimes be determined solely from the degree of linearity-nonlinearity in the system. Experimental data from a three-story building model is analyzed using these features and some important application issues are discussed.},

abstract = {This study explores the feasibility of using a non-contact guided wave imaging system to detect hidden delamination in multi-layer composites. The study is conducted in two phases. In the first phase, Lamb waves are excited by a lead (Pb) Zirconate Titanate transducer (PZT) mounted on the surface of a composite plate, and the out-of-plane velocity field is measured using a one-dimensional (1D) scanning laser Doppler vibrometer (LDV). From the scanned time signals, wavefield images are constructed and processed to study the interaction of Lamb waves with delamination. The paper presents additional signal and image processing techniques used to highlight the defect in the scanned area. The techniques are demonstrated using experimental data collected from a 1.8. mm thick multi-layer composite. In the second phase, a completely non-contact system is described to excite and measure guided waves. A modulated continuous wave (CW) laser source in conjunction with a photodiode is used to wirelessly excite an attached PZT and the resulting waves are again sensed using the vibrometer. The non-contact system is used to excite and measure elastic waves in a composite channel test article. The elastic wave propagation image sequences are created from the non-contact excitation system. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {The performance of traditional visual inspection by handcrafted features for crack and leakage defects of metro shield tunnel is hardly satisfactory nowadays because it is low-efficient to distinguish defects from some interference such as segmental joints, bolt holes, cables and manual marks. Based on deep learning (DL), this paper proposes a novel image recognition algorithm for semantic segmentation of crack and leakage defects of metro shield tunnel using hierarchies of features extracted by fully convolutional network (FCN). The defect images in training dataset and testing dataset are captured via a self-developed image acquisition equipment named Moving Tunnel Inspection (MTI-200a). After the establishment of image datasets, FCN models of crack and leakage are separately trained through several iterations of forward inference and backward learning. Semantic segmentation of defect images is implemented via the corresponding FCN models using two-stream algorithm, i.e. one stream is used to recognize the crack by sliding-window-assembling operation and the other is adopted for the leakage by resizing-interpolation operation. Compared with two frequently-used traditional methods, i.e. region growing algorithm (RGA) and adaptive thresholding algorithm (ATA), great superiority of the proposed method in terms of recognition results, inference time and error rates is shown based on four typical types of defect images which are crack-only image, leakage-only image, two-defect-nonoverlapping (TDN) image, two-defect-overlapping (TDO) image. The proposed method using DL can be employed to rapidly and accurately recognize defects for structure health monitoring and maintenance of metro shield tunnels.},

The wavenumbers are correlated to trapped waves in the delamination region. Novel approaches for imaging the composite panels using guided waves are discussed and demonstrated for quantitative evaluation of the delamination damage. A filter reconstruction imaging method is shown to provide a rapid technique to locate delamination damage by showing where guided wave energy is trapped. A spatial wavenumber-based imaging algorithm is applied to calculate wavenumber values at each spatial location and highlights the delamination damage as regions with larger wavenumber values. The imaging approaches are demonstrated using experimental data from a plate with a simulated delamination (teflon insert) and from a plate containing impact-induced delamination damage. The methods are also applied to a multiple mode guided wave case to demonstrate application to complex wave cases.},

abstract = {Most of the semantic segmentation approaches have been developed for single image segmentation, and hence, video sequences are currently segmented by processing each frame of the video sequence separately. The disadvantage of this is that temporal image information is not considered, which improves the performance of the segmentation approach. One possibility to include temporal information is to use recurrent neural networks. However, there are only a few approaches using recurrent networks for video segmentation so far. These approaches extend the encoder-decoder network architecture of well-known segmentation approaches and place convolutional LSTM layers between encoder and decoder. However, in this paper it is shown that this position is not optimal, and that other positions in the network exhibit better performance. Nowadays, state-of-the-art segmentation approaches rarely use the classical encoder-decoder structure, but use multi-branch architectures. These architectures are more complex, and hence, it is more difficult to place the recurrent units at a proper position. In this work, the multi-branch architectures are extended by convolutional LSTM layers at different positions and evaluated on two different datasets in order to find the best one. It turned out that the proposed approach outperforms the pure CNN-based approach for up to 1.6 percent.},

Methods to generate appropriate input datasets and network architectures for impact localization and characterization were proposed, investigated and optimized. The ultrasonic waves generated by external impact events and recorded by piezoelectric sensors are transferred to 2D images which are used for impact detection and characterization. The accuracy of the detection was tested on a composite fuselage panel which was shown to be over 94%. In addition, the scalability of this metamodelling technique has been investigated by training the CNN metamodels with the data from part of the stiffened panel and testing the performance on other sections with similar geometry. Impacts were detected with an accuracy of over 95%. Impact energy levels were also successfully categorized while trained at coupon level and applied to sub-components with greater complexity. These results validated the applicability of the proposed CNN-based metamodel to real-life application such as composite aircraft parts.},

abstract = {The present paper deals with an approach in predicting the presence of embedded delaminations (in terms of their size, shape and location) in fibre reinforced plastic composite laminates using natural frequencies as indicative parameters and artificial neural network as a learning tool. Here, a 3D finite element model has been used to model [0]20 graphite/epoxy plate having an embedded delamination at the interface of two [0]10 sub-laminates. Hundreds of finite element models have been run to generate natural frequencies up to 10 modes for various combinations of size, shape and location of embedded delamination in a graphite/epoxy plate and then these data have been used to train a back propagation neural network till the network learns to an acceptable level of accuracy. The trained network has been tested to predict the presence of a delamination along with its size, shape and location from the input natural frequencies. An optimum network architecture has been established which can effectively learn the pattern. It has been observed that, the network can learn effectively about the size, shape and location of the embedded delamination present in the laminate and can predict reasonably well when tested with unknown data set. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {This research is related to a signal processing of full wavefield data as an effective tool for detection, localization and visualization of a crack growth in thin-walled structures. Full wavefield data of propagating Lamb waves in structures such as plates and shells made out of metallic alloys and composite laminates contain a wealth of information about wave pattern anomalies due to occurrence of a damage. The aim is to demonstrate a method for enhancing damage visualization in structures such that estimation of the length and orientation of the crack can be easily obtained. The proposed signal processing involves application of discrete fast Fourier transform, wavenumber domain filtering and inverse discrete Fourier transform. The method is further enhanced by a technique for compensation of the wave attenuation so that the effects of structural damage have the same influence regardless of the location. The concept is first illustrated on numerically simulated data, and then tested on experimental results. In the experiments, full wavefield measurements are obtained using a scanning laser Doppler vibrometer, which allows the measurement of displacements and/or velocities along three axes over a user-defined grid. In the proposed method only out-of-plane velocities are used. Tests performed on simple aluminum and composite plates with artificially introduced longitudinal cracks confirm the effectiveness of the method and its potential for application to the inspection of a variety of structural components. {\textcopyright}2014 Elsevier Ltd.

We begin with an overview of damage prognosis, and a description of the basic methodology of guided-wave SHM. We then review developments from the open literature in various aspects of this truly multidisciplinary field. First, we discuss different transducer technologies, including both piezoelectric and non-conventional popular and non-conventional piezoelectric transducers. Next, we examine guided-wave theory, tracing its early history down to modern developments. Following this, we detail the efforts into models for guided-wave excitation by SHM transducers. Then, we review several signal processing related works. The next topic in Section 6 is guided-wave SHM system development, and we explore various packaging ideas, integrated solutions and efforts to examine robustness to different service conditions. We also highlight the broad spectrum of applications in which this technology has been tested. We then present some investigations that have attempted to combine guided-wave approaches with other complementary SHM technologies for better system performance. Finally, we propose desirable developments for further advancement of this field. {\textcopyright} 2007 SAGE Publications.},

Piezoelectric sensors, embedded in the aircraft sheathing, generate Lamb waves with the aim to monitor the structural integrity of complex structure parts. The ultrasonic signals obtained from the sensor pairs arranged in pitch-catch configuration are used for the calculation of a number of different damage indices. The damage indices are then used as inputs for a classifier employing an artificial neural network (ANN) that is trained to perform structure condition assessment. Efficiency of the ANN classifier trained on artificial data generated from the numerical simulations performed using linear interaction simulation approach is investigated. The resulting classification results are compared with those obtained for the ANN trained on experimental data from the real specimens.},

abstract = {This study proposes a complete noncontact laser ultrasonic wavefield imaging technique to automatically detect and visualize hidden delamination and debonding in composite structures. First, ultrasonic wavefield is obtained from a target structure by scanning a Nd:YAG pulse laser beam for ultrasonic wave generation and measuring the corresponding ultrasonic responses using a laser Doppler vibrometer. Then, hidden damages are identified and visualized through adoption of a standing wave filter, which can isolate damage-induced standing waves from the obtained wavefield. The proposed technique has following advantages over the existing techniques: (1) it does not require any sensor installation; (2) it is noninvasive, rapidly deployable and applicable to harsh environments; and (3) it can visualize damage with high spatial resolution without any baseline data, which enables automated and intuitive damage diagnosis. The feasibility of the proposed technique is demonstrated by visualizing a debonding in a carbon fiber reinforced plastic aircraft wing and a delamination in a glass fiber reinforced plastic wind turbine blade. Furthermore, the effects of temperature and static loading variations on the proposed technique are also examined. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

Segments represent objects or parts of objects and comprise sets of super-pixels. Image segmentation sorts pixels into larger components, eliminating the need to believe individual pixels as units of observation. Brain tumour segmentation is a crucial task in medical image segmentation. Early diagnosis of brain tumours plays a crucial role in improving treatment possibilities and increases the survival rate of the patients. Manual segmentation of the brain tumours for cancer diagnosis, from great deal of MRI images generated in clinical routine, may be a difficult and time-consuming task. There is a requirement for automatic brain tumour image segmentation. The method is proposed to segment normal tissues like substantial alba, grey matter, spinal fluid, and abnormal tissue like tumour part from a resonance Imaging (MRI) automatically. The system also uses to segment the tumour cells along the morphological filtering are going to be wont to remove background noises for smoothening of region.

abstract = {Manual tracing of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) represents the gold standard for segmentation in clinical neuropsychiatric research studies, however automated approaches are increasingly used due to its time limitations. The accuracy of segmentation techniques for subcortical structures has not been systematically investigated in large samples. We compared the accuracy of fully automated [(i) model-based: FSL-FIRST; (ii) patch-based: volBrain], semi–automated (FreeSurfer) and stereological (Measure{\textregistered}) segmentation techniques with manual tracing (ITK-SNAP) for delineating volumes of the caudate (easy-to-segment) and the hippocampus (difficult-to-segment). High resolution 1.5 T T1-weighted MR images were obtained from 177 patients with major psychiatric disorders and 104 healthy participants. The relative consistency (partial correlation), absolute agreement (intraclass correlation coefficient, ICC) and potential technique bias (Bland–Altman plots) of each technique was compared with manual segmentation. Each technique yielded high correlations (0.77–0.87, p < 0.0001) and moderate ICC's (0.28–0.49) relative to manual segmentation for the caudate. For the hippocampus, stereology yielded good consistency (0.52–0.55, p < 0.0001) and ICC (0.47–0.49), whereas automated and semi-automated techniques yielded poor ICC (0.07–0.10) and moderate consistency (0.35–0.62, p < 0.0001). Bias was least using stereology for segmentation of the hippocampus and using FreeSurfer for segmentation of the caudate. In a typical neuropsychiatric MRI dataset, automated segmentation techniques provide good accuracy for an easy-to-segment structure such as the caudate, whereas for the hippocampus, a reasonable correlation with volume but poor absolute agreement was demonstrated. This indicates manual or stereological volume estimation should be considered for studies that require high levels of precision such as those with small sample size.},

Identifying a successful damage feature is a critical step in computationally efficient damage detection and characterization process; however, such feature identification process is generally time-consuming and often difficult to execute. The CNN model is a deep learning model that can be trained to represent high dimensional data for which traditional mathematical model is ill to describe. This study first formalizes the nondestructive evaluation (NDE) problem of notch-type crack damage detection in thin metal plates into an image classification problem in the machine learning domain, which is then solved with a deep CNN model trained using Lamb wave data converted images. Analytical formulas have been derived for generating Lamb wave signals subsequently used for training and validation test of the proposed crack damage detection technique for thin metal plates. Experimental test data from aluminum plate with simulated notch damage has also been used to independently validate the CNN model. The study results show its potential as a promising NDE tool for crack damage detection in thin plate structures.},

abstract = {Structural health monitoring has received remarkable attention due to the arising structural safety problems. Most of these structural health problems are accumulative damages such as slight changes in structural deformations which are very hard to be detected. In addition, the complexity of real structure and environmental noises make structural health monitoring more difficult. Existing methods largely use various types of sensors to collect useful parameters and then train a machine learning model to diagnose damage level and location, in which a large amount of training data are needed for the model training, while the labeled data are rare in the real world. To overcome this problem, sparse coding is employed in this paper to achieve structural health monitoring of a bridge equipped with a wireless sensor network, so that a large amount of unlabeled examples can be used to train a feature extractor based on the sparse coding algorithm. Features learned from sparse coding are then used to train a neural network classifier to distinguish different statuses of the bridge. Experimental results show the sparse coding-based deep learning algorithm achieves higher accuracy for structural health monitoring under the same level of environmental noises, compared with some existing methods.},

abstract = {The paper presents signal and image processing algorithms to automatically detect delamination and disbond in composite plates from wavefield images obtained using a scanning laser Doppler vibrometer (LDV). Lamb waves are excited by a lead zirconate titanate transducer (PZT) mounted on the surface of a composite plate, and the out-of-plane velocity field is measured using an LDV. From the scanned time signals, wavefield images are constructed and processed to study the interaction of Lamb waves with hidden delaminations and disbonds. In particular, the frequency-wavenumber (f-k) domain filter and the Laplacian image filter are used to enhance the visibility of defects in the scanned images. Thereafter, a statistical cluster detection algorithm is used to identify the defect location and distinguish damaged specimens from undamaged ones. {\textcopyright} 2011 IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract = {Laminated composites are susceptible to delamination due to their weak transverse tensile and interlaminar shear strengths as compared to their in-plane properties. Delamination damage can occur internally, where it is not visible to the naked eye. Development of reliable, quantitative techniques for detecting delamination damage in laminated composite components will be imperative for safe and functional optimally designed next-generation composite structures. In this article, we study the potential of using Lamb waves for delamination detection and quantification, using model-assisted data acquisition. Novel wavenumber analysis approaches are developed and discussed to show how they can be used to investigate Lamb wave interactions with delaminated plies. Ultrasonic wave simulations are implemented to provide both in-plane and out-of-plane wave motion for the wavenumber studies. The out-of-plane results are verified against data obtained from experimental tests. It is found that the wavenumber methods can not only determine the delaminated region of the plate and its length, but can also identify the plies between which the delamination occurs. We envision that the wavenumber approaches can lead to a complete delamination quantification in the future.},

abstract = {The Dice score and Jaccard index are commonly used metrics for the evaluation of segmentation tasks in medical imaging. Convolutional neural networks trained for image segmentation tasks are usually optimized for (weighted) cross-entropy. This introduces an adverse discrepancy between the learning optimization objective (the loss) and the end target metric. Recent works in computer vision have proposed soft surrogates to alleviate this discrepancy and directly optimize the desired metric, either through relaxations (soft-Dice, soft-Jaccard) or submodular optimization (Lov{\'{a}}sz-softmax). The aim of this study is two-fold. First, we investigate the theoretical differences in a risk minimization framework and question the existence of a weighted cross-entropy loss with weights theoretically optimized to surrogate Dice or Jaccard. Second, we empirically investigate the behavior of the aforementioned loss functions w.r.t. evaluation with Dice score and Jaccard index on five medical segmentation tasks. Through the application of relative approximation bounds, we show that all surrogates are equivalent up to a multiplicative factor, and that no optimal weighting of cross-entropy exists to approximate Dice or Jaccard measures. We validate these findings empirically and show that, while it is important to opt for one of the target metric surrogates rather than a cross-entropy-based loss, the choice of the surrogate does not make a statistical difference on a wide range of medical segmentation tasks.},

Modal analysis is carried out using piezoceramic patches as both sensors and actuators on structure members. Using piezoceramic actuators, the member is excited at different sinusoidal frequencies, and, using piezoceramic sensors, the response of the member is measured. The advantage of using active materials for system identification is that the condition Of the Structure can be continuously monitored, and, by using an integrated microprocessor, the sensor output can be continuously evaluated. A back-propagation neural network has been trained with the frequencies of the first five modes obtained from modal-analysis data from piezoceramic sensors in both damaged and healthy composite beams. The effectiveness of neural networks in determining the location and size of any delamination is discussed. {\textcopyright} 1994 IOP Publishing Ltd.},

The text offers mathematical and conceptual background, covering relevant concepts in linear algebra, probability theory and information theory, numerical computation, and machine learning. It describes deep learning techniques used by practitioners in industry, including deep feedforward networks, regularization, optimization algorithms, convolutional networks, sequence modeling, and practical methodology; and it surveys such applications as natural language processing, speech recognition, computer vision, online recommendation systems, bioinformatics, and video games. Finally, the book offers research perspectives, covering such theoretical topics as linear factor models, autoencoders, representation learning, structured probabilistic models, Monte Carlo methods, the partition function, approximate inference, and deep generative models.

When these permanently attached transducers are driven with an impulsive excitation, broadband Lamb waves are generated and received signals are complex, typically containing multiple modes as well as many boundary reflections. The complexity of the signals, including dispersive effects, can be reduced by digital bandpass filtering, and changes in these filtered signals over time can be monitored to detect and localize damage. Results are reported here from an experimental study whereby artificial damage was introduced in an aluminum plate in the form of through holes drilled at various locations. Time shift averaging algorithms were applied to differential signals filtered at multiple frequencies, resulting in many images for the same structural state, and these images were fused to improve damage localization and background noise. Individual and fused images were analyzed to quantify their ability to localize damage. The results show the efficacy of the imaging method as well as the significant improvement resulting from image fusion. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Yet, these methods require a considerable amount of time to acquire full wavefield data. Therefore, there is a significant need to reduce acquisition time. In this preliminary work, we present a transfer learning approach for reducing the number of sampled measurements necessary. Our method utilizes numerical simula- tions, combined with a small number of spatially sampled random measurements from an experimental structure, to reconstruct full wavefield data. Specifically, we use an autoencoder neural network to learn low-dimensional representations of wave propagation from numerical simulations. We then input a few experimental measurements into the neural network to reconstruct full wave- field data. To demonstrate the ability of our framework, we show our initial success in three scenarios. We show reconstruction accuracies of 86% with one-fourth of the total measurements.},

@article{jia2016deep,
abstract = {Aiming to promptly process the massive fault data and automatically provide accurate diagnosis results, numerous studies have been conducted on intelligent fault diagnosis of rotating machinery. Among these studies, the methods based on artificial neural networks (ANNs) are commonly used, which employ signal processing techniques for extracting features and further input the features to ANNs for classifying faults. Though these methods did work in intelligent fault diagnosis of rotating machinery, they still have two deficiencies. (1) The features are manually extracted depending on much prior knowledge about signal processing techniques and diagnostic expertise. In addition, these manual features are extracted according to a specific diagnosis issue and probably unsuitable for other issues. (2) The ANNs adopted in these methods have shallow architectures, which limits the capacity of ANNs to learn the complex non-linear relationships in fault diagnosis issues. As a breakthrough in artificial intelligence, deep learning holds the potential to overcome the aforementioned deficiencies. Through deep learning, deep neural networks (DNNs) with deep architectures, instead of shallow ones, could be established to mine the useful information from raw data and approximate complex non-linear functions. Based on DNNs, a novel intelligent method is proposed in this paper to overcome the deficiencies of the aforementioned intelligent diagnosis methods. The effectiveness of the proposed method is validated using datasets from rolling element bearings and planetary gearboxes. These datasets contain massive measured signals involving different health conditions under various operating conditions. The diagnosis results show that the proposed method is able to not only adaptively mine available fault characteristics from the measured signals, but also obtain superior diagnosis accuracy compared with the existing methods.},

abstract = {This article proposes an in situ structural health monitoring method able to locate the impact source and to determine the flexural Lamb mode A0 velocity in composite structures with unknown lay-up and cross section. The algorithm is based on the differences of the stress waves measured by six surface-attached acoustic emission piezoelectric (lead zirconate titanate) sensors and is branched off into two steps. In the first step, the magnitude of the squared modulus of continuous wavelet transform, which guarantees high accuracy in the time-frequency analysis of the acoustic waves, was used to identify the time of arrival of the flexural Lamb wave. Then, the coordinates of the impact location and the group speed values are obtained by solving a set of non-linear equations through a combination of local Newton's iterative method associated with line search and polynomial backtracking techniques. The proposed method, in contrast to the current impact localization algorithms, does not require a priori knowledge of the anisotropy angular-group velocity pattern of the measured waveforms as well as the mechanical properties of the structure. To validate this method, experimental location testing was conducted on two different composite structures: a quasi-isotropic carbon fibre-reinforced plastic laminate and a sandwich panel. The results showed that source location was achieved with satisfactory accuracy (maximum error in estimation of the impact location was approximately 3 mm for quasi-isotropic carbon fibre-reinforced plastic panel and nearly 2 mm for sandwich plate), requiring little computational time (nearly 1 s). In addition, the values of the fundamental flexural Lamb mode A0 obtained from the optimization algorithm were compared with those determined by a numerical spectral finite element method. {\textcopyright} The Author(s) 2012.},

abstract = {A structural damage detection method based on parameter identification using an iterative neural network (NN) technique is proposed in this study. The NN model is first trained off-line using an initial training data set that consists of assumed structural parameters as outputs and their corresponding dynamic characteristics as inputs. The structural parameters are assumed with different levels of reduction to simulate various degrees of structural damage. The concept of orthogonal array is adopted to generate the representative combinations of parameter changes, which can significantly reduce the number of training data while maintaining the data completeness. A modified back-propagation learning algorithm is proposed which can overcome possible saturation of the sigmoid function and speed up the training process. The trained NN model is used to predict the structural parameters by feeding in measured dynamic characteristics. The predicted structural parameters are then used in the FE model to calculate the dynamic characteristics. The NN model would go through a retraining process if the calculated characteristics deviate from the measured ones. The identified structural parameters are then used to infer the location and the extent of structural damages. The proposed method is verified both numerically and experimentally using a clamped-clamped T beam. The results indicate that the current approach can identify both the location and the extent of damages in the beam.},

A modified time reversal method (MTRM) is developed which requires only one transducer to actuate signals and the other transducer acts as a sensor for any signal path. An 8-layer symmetric cross-ply carbon-epoxy composite plate is fabricated and four PZT actuators/sensors are surface bonded at the corners of the plate. A 20 kHz, 9.5 cycle tone burst signal is used to generate fundamental asymmetric Lamb waves with high signal-to-noise ratio and low dispersion. Theoretical analysis and experimental measurements show that conventional time reversal method (TRM) and the MTRM yield identical signals at the end of time reversal. The composite plate is impacted incrementally with a steel ball to cause three levels of damage and MTRM is applied for prediction of damage severity. Results show that magnitudes of the two damage indices used are directly correlated to the severity of damage along any signal path. The development of MTRM paves the way for implementing time reversal of signals using a single actuator and multiple sensors, including non-contact sensor such as a laser vibrometer. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

We found that a small number of patterns is sufficient to model the vast majority of traffic scenes and show how these patterns can be learned. As evidenced by our experiments, this high-level reasoning significantly improves the overall scene estimation as well as the vehicle-to-lane association when compared to state-of-the-art approaches. {\textcopyright} 2013 IEEE.},

abstract = {Microscopic algae segmentation, specifically of diatoms, is an essential procedure for water quality assessment. The segmentation of these microalgae is still a challenge for computer vision. This paper addresses for the first time this problem using deep learning approaches to predict exactly those pixels that belong to each class, i.e., diatom and non diatom. A comparison between semantic segmentation and instance segmentation is carried out, and the performance of these methods is evaluated in the presence of different types of noise. The trained models are then evaluated with the same raw images used for manual diatom identification. A total of 126 images of the entire field of view at 60x magnification, with a size of 2592x1944 pixels, are analyzed. The images contain 10 different taxa plus debris and fragments. The best results were obtained with instance segmentation achieving an average precision of 85% with 86% sensitivity and 91% specificity (up to 92% precision with 98%, both sensitivity and specificity for some taxa). Semantic segmentation was able to improve the average sensitivity up to 95% but decreasing the specificity down to 60% and precision to 57%. Instance segmentation was also able to properly separate diatoms when overlap occurs, which helps estimate the number of diatoms, a key requirement for water quality grading.},

In composite materials, anisotropy leads to some challenges in using conventional damage location methods, which are developed for isotropic materials. In the hybrid DAS-SR method, the DAS and SR methods were combined as a complement of each other. To investigate the DAS-SR method for composite structures, the group velocity of the travelling wave for different directions was first measured experimentally via PZTs. The DAS and SR formulations were then modified to be compatible with the direction-dependent group velocities. The results show that this modification increases the accuracy of the DAS and SR methods for damage location in a composite plate. However, using group-velocity instead of phase-velocity in the standard SR method, causes some model mismatch and errors in the damage localization and this problem was solved by using the modified hybrid DAS-SR method. The experimental results demonstrated that the performance of the modified hybrid method for detection and location of barely visible impact damages as well as for multi-location artificial damages is better than that of the DAS and SR methods when separately used.},

abstract = {Vision-based semantic segmentation in urban scenarios is a key functionality for autonomous driving. Recent revolutionary results of deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) foreshadow the advent of reliable classifiers to perform such visual tasks. However, DCNNs require learning of many parameters from raw images, thus, having a sufficient amount of diverse images with class annotations is needed. These annotations are obtained via cumbersome, human labour which is particularly challenging for semantic segmentation since pixel-level annotations are required. In this paper, we propose to use a virtual world to automatically generate realistic synthetic images with pixel-level annotations. Then, we address the question of how useful such data can be for semantic segmentation - in particular, when using a DCNN paradigm. In order to answer this question we have generated a synthetic collection of diverse urban images, named SYNTHIA, with automatically generated class annotations. We use SYNTHIA in combination with publicly available real-world urban images with manually provided annotations. Then, we conduct experiments with DCNNs that show how the inclusion of SYNTHIA in the training stage significantly improves performance on the semantic segmentation task.},

abstract = {Structures that are difficult to maintain and access need to have an efficient and robust process for continuous monitoring. Such monitoring through damage detection and identification studies is present in several engineering applications as it allows that corrective measures be applied in order to guarantee the structural safety of a given structure, machine or equipment. In particular, laminated composite materials, often used in aeronautical structures, have a complex failure mechanism where delamination or cracks in these materials are often not visible on the surface. Thus, the use of optimization methods for the characterization of damages in these materials becomes relevant. In this study, both the metaheuristic sunflower optimization, the artificial neural networks and the response surface method were used to solve an inverse crack identification problem. The crack was modeled as a thin elliptical hole in a rectangular laminated plate numerically modeled using the finite element method. As a result of the methods used, different approaches to the problem were obtained that present reliable shape, size and position identification of a crack sized between 3 and 30 mm. The results showed substantial and promising results in the uses of both metaheuristic techniques and artificial neural networks. However, neural networks have a certain competitive advantage over optimization techniques as long as the data that feeds the model present a certain level of quantity and quality. Results obtained were able to identify all damage parameters (location, extension and orientation), with errors less than 1%.},

Remote sensing data have been widely used for the study of land cover, enabling efficient mapping of changes of the Earth surface from Space. Although the availability of high-resolution remote sensing imagery increases significantly every year, traditional land cover analysis approaches based on pixel and object levels are not optimal. Recent advancement in deep learning has achieved remarkable success on image recognition field and has shown potential in high spatial resolution remote sensing applications, including classification and object detection. In this paper, a comprehensive review on land cover classification and object detection approaches using high resolution imagery is provided. Through two case studies, we demonstrated the applications of the state-of-the-art deep learning models to high spatial resolution remote sensing data for land cover classification and object detection and evaluated their performances against traditional approaches. For a land cover classification task, the deep-learning-based methods provide an end-to-end solution by using both spatial and spectral information. They have shown better performance than the traditional pixel-based method, especially for the categories of different vegetation. For an objective detection task, the deep-learning-based object detection method achieved more than 98% accuracy in a large area; its high accuracy and efficiency could relieve the burden of the traditional, labour-intensive method. However, considering the diversity of remote sensing data, more training datasets are required in order to improve the generalisation and the robustness of deep learning-based models.},

Different information about the state of the structure can be obtained in the process, among them, detection, localization and classification of damages are mainly studied in order to avoid unnecessary maintenance procedures in civilian and military structures in several applications. To carry out SHM in prac- tice, two different approaches are used, the first is based on modelling which requires to build a very detailed model of the structure, while the second is by means of data-driven approaches which use information collected from the structure under different struc- tural states and perform an analysis by means of data analysis .

Delamination is of particular interest because it can cause catastrophic failure of the composite structure. One consequence of delamination in a composite structure is a change in its stiffness. This change in stiffness will degrade the modal frequencies of the composite structure. Modal testing of a perfect beam and beams with different delamination size is conducted using polyvinylidene fluoride film (PVDF) sensors and piezoceramic (PZT) patch with sine sweep actuation. Modal testing of beams is also conducted using PVDF sensors and instrumented hammer excitation. The results of piezoceramic patch excitation and instrumented hammer excitation are discussed. The experimental modal frequencies are compared with the results obtained using a simplified beam theory. Also, backpropagation neural network models are developed using the results from the beam theory and used to predict delamination size. The effect of learning rate and momentum rate on neural network performance are discussed. Modal frequencies can be easily and accurately obtained with PZT patch excitation and PVDF sensing. There is good agreement between modal frequencies from modal testing and those from the simplified beam theory. The neural network models developed successfully predict delamination size.},

In the this article, we present our studies on Lamb wave propagation characterization and crack detection using a hybrid lead zirconate titanate (PZT)-laser vibrometer system and frequency-wave number analysis. A scanning laser Doppler vibrometer is used to acquiring high-resolution time-space Lamb wavefield excited by a PZT actuator. The recorded wavefield is then transformed to frequency-wave number domain by two-dimensional Fourier transform. Wave spectrum in the frequency-wave number domain shows clear distinction among Lamb wave modes being present. These concepts are illustrated through several experimental tests. However, the space information is lost during this transformation. A short-space two-dimensional Fourier transform is then adopted to obtain the frequency-wave number spectra at various spatial locations, resulting in the space-frequency-wave number representation, which can show how the frequency-wave number component varies with respect to space dimension. It provides a means to study the wave propagation from the perspective of wave number domain.

abstract = {In addition to the typical random errors that vary between consecutive measurements, the measurements for most all sensors used for target tracking include bias errors that remain relatively fixed during a target tracking episode and are typically characterized by an a priori mean and covariance. Since the bias errors are approximately fixed during a tracking episode, those errors violate the typical assumption of the measurement errors being white noise. Inflating the measurement covariance of the random errors by adding the bias covariance gives track covariances that poorly represent the true errors. The Schmidt-Kalman filter can be used to prevent the track covariances from becoming artificially too small. However, the Schmidt-Kalman filter produces a track covariance that encompasses the random and bias errors. In this paper, the authors formulate the target tracking as a least-square estimation (LSE) problem and show that the track covariance due to the bias errors can be isolated from the track covariance due the random errors. The authors utilize Monte Carlo simulations to verify and illustrate the accuracy of isolation of the bias and random covariances.},

This work is part of the efforts which have applied structural health monitoring to the Sydney Harbour Bridge - one of Australia's iconic structures. It combines dimensionality reduction and pattern recognition techniques to accurately and efficiently distinguish faulty components from well-functioning ones. Specifically, random projection is used for dimensionality reduction on the vibration feature data. Then, healthy and damaged patterns of bridge components are learned in the lower dimensional projected space using supervised and unsupervised machine learning methods, namely, support vector machine and one-class support vector machine. The experimental results using data from a laboratory-based building structure and the Sydney Harbour Bridge showed high feasibility of applying machine learning techniques to dimensionality reduction and damage detection in structural health monitoring. Random projection combined with support vector machine significantly reduces the computational time while maintaining the detection accuracy. The proposed method also outperformed popular dimensionality reduction techniques. The computational time of the method using random projection can be more than 200 times faster than that without using dimensionality reduction while still achieving similar detection accuracy. {\textcopyright} The Author(s) 2014.},

abstract = {Civil and military structures are susceptible and vulnerable to damage due to the environmental and operational conditions. Therefore, the implementation of technology to provide robust solutions in damage identification (by using signals acquired directly from the structure) is a requirement to reduce operational and maintenance costs. In this sense, the use of sensors permanently attached to the structures has demonstrated a great versatility and benefit since the inspection system can be automated. This automation is carried out with signal processing tasks with the aim of a pattern recognition analysis. This work presents the detailed description of a structural health monitoring (SHM) system based on the use of a piezoelectric (PZT) active system. The SHM system includes: (i) the use of a piezoelectric sensor network to excite the structure and collect the measured dynamic response, in several actuation phases; (ii) data organization; (iii) advanced signal processing techniques to define the feature vectors; and finally; (iv) the nearest neighbor algorithm as a machine learning approach to classify different kinds of damage. A description of the experimental setup, the experimental validation and a discussion of the results from two different structures are included and analyzed.},

For example, the recent success and rapid commercialization of deep learning has catapulted technical achievements in many fields, including computer vision, speech recognition, games, and machine translation. These successes present new opportunities for advancing nondestructive evaluation (NDE) techniques. This paper reviews the fundamental concepts of ML and their underlying connections to statistics. We then discuss past applications and methods of ML for NDE. We also describe the still unresolved challenges for this field, such as the unavailability of reliable training data.

abstract = {Health assessment and monitoring of engineered systems have become one of the fastest growing multi-disciplinary research areas over the last two decades. One of the largest concerns in structural health monitoring is how to infer structural conditions from the measurements and the data collected by sensors. The ultimate aim is to detect the structural damages with a high level of certainty and hence to extend the life of structures. In this study, a new strategy for structural damage detection is proposed using least square support vector machines based on a new combinational kernel. Thin plate spline Littlewood–Paley wavelet kernel function introduced in this article is a novel combinational kernel function, which combines thin plate spline radial basis function kernel with local characteristics and a modified Littlewood–Paley wavelet kernel function with global characteristics. During the process of structural damage detection, a social harmony search algorithm optimizes the parameters of least square support vector machine and the thin plate spline Littlewood–Paley wavelet kernel. The results obtained by this method are compared with least square support vector machine based on the other combinational and conventional kernels. These results show that the accuracy of damage detection based on least square support vector machine with thin plate spline Littlewood–Paley wavelet kernel is higher than other methods that utilize conventional kernels under similar conditions. In comparison with other combinational kernels, least square support vector machine with thin plate spline Littlewood–Paley wavelet kernel possesses a better dissemination and learning ability by incorporating the advantages of radial basis function kernel and wavelet kernel functions.},

abstract = {Among the various techniques available, ultrasonic Lamb waves offer a convenient method of evaluating composite materials. Since the Lamb wave velocity depends on the elastic properties of a structure, an effective tool exists to monitor damage in composites by measuring the velocity of these waves. Lamb wave measurements can propagate over long distances and are sensitive to the desired in-plane elastic properties of the material. This paper describes two studies which monitor fatigue damage and two studies which monitor thermal damage in composites using Lamb waves. In the fatigue studies, the Lamb wave velocity is compared to modulus measurements obtained using strain gage measurements in the first experiment and the velocity is monitored along with the crack density in the second. In the thermal damage studies, one examines samples which were exposed to varying temperatures for a three minute duration and the second includes rapid thermal damage in composites by intense laser beams. In all studies, the Lamb wave velocity is demonstrated to be an excellent method to monitor damage in composites},

abstract = {Computer vision-based techniques were developed to overcome the limitations of visual inspection by trained human resources and to detect structural damage in images remotely, but most methods detect only specific types of damage, such as concrete or steel cracks. To provide quasi real-time simultaneous detection of multiple types of damages, a Faster Region-based Convolutional Neural Network (Faster R-CNN)-based structural visual inspection method is proposed. To realize this, a database including 2,366 images (with 500 × 375 pixels) labeled for five types of damages—concrete crack, steel corrosion with two levels (medium and high), bolt corrosion, and steel delamination—is developed. Then, the architecture of the Faster R-CNN is modified, trained, validated, and tested using this database. Results show 90.6%, 83.4%, 82.1%, 98.1%, and 84.7% average precision (AP) ratings for the five damage types, respectively, with a mean AP of 87.8%. The robustness of the trained Faster R-CNN is evaluated and demonstrated using 11 new 6,000 × 4,000-pixel images taken of different structures. Its performance is also compared to that of the traditional CNN-based method. Considering that the proposed method provides a remarkably fast test speed (0.03 seconds per image with 500 × 375 resolution), a framework for quasi real-time damage detection on video using the trained networks is developed.},

@article{Michaels2008a,
abstract = {Permanently attached piezoelectric sensors arranged in a spatially distributed array are under consideration for structural health monitoring systems incorporating active ultrasonic methods. Most damage detection and localization methods that have been proposed are based upon comparing monitored signals to baselines recorded from the structure prior to initiation of damage. To be effective, this comparison process must take into account any conditions other than damage that have changed the ultrasonic signals. Proposed here is a two-step process whereby damage is first detected and is then localized and characterized. The detection strategy considers the long time behavior of the signals in the diffuse-like regime where distinct echoes can no longer be identified. The localization strategy is to generate images of damage based upon the early time regime when discrete echoes from boundary reflections and scattering sites are meaningful. Results are shown for an aluminum plate with artificial damage introduced in combination with temperature variations. The loss of local temporal coherence combined with an optimal baseline selection procedure is shown to be effective for the detection of damage, and a delay-and-sum imaging method applied to the residual signals both localizes the damage and provides characterization information. {\textcopyright} 2008 IOP Publishing Ltd.},

This paper presents part of an experimental and analytical survey of candidate methods for in situ damage detection of composite materials. Experimental results are presented for the application of Lamb wave techniques to quasi-isotropic graphite/epoxy test specimens containing representative damage modes, including delamination, transverse ply cracks and through-holes. Linear wave scans were performed on narrow laminated specimens and sandwich beams with various cores by monitoring the transmitted waves with piezoceramic sensors. Optimal actuator and sensor configurations were devised through experimentation, and various types of driving signal were explored. These experiments provided a procedure capable of easily and accurately determining the time of flight of a Lamb wave pulse between an actuator and sensor. Lamb wave techniques provide more information about damage presence and severity than previously tested methods (frequency response techniques), and provide the possibility of determining damage location due to their local response nature. These methods may prove suitable for structural health monitoring applications since they travel long distances and can be applied with conformable piezoelectric actuators and sensors that require little power.},

abstract = {Vibration analysis is a well-established technique for condition monitoring of rotating machines as the vibration patterns differ depending on the fault or machine condition. Currently, mainly manually-engineered features, such as the ball pass frequencies of the raceway, RMS, kurtosis an crest, are used for automatic fault detection. Unfortunately, engineering and interpreting such features requires a significant level of human expertise. To enable non-experts in vibration analysis to perform condition monitoring, the overhead of feature engineering for specific faults needs to be reduced as much as possible. Therefore, in this article we propose a feature learning model for condition monitoring based on convolutional neural networks. The goal of this approach is to autonomously learn useful features for bearing fault detection from the data itself. Several types of bearing faults such as outer-raceway faults and lubrication degradation are considered, but also healthy bearings and rotor imbalance are included. For each condition, several bearings are tested to ensure generalization of the fault-detection system. Furthermore, the feature-learning based approach is compared to a feature-engineering based approach using the same data to objectively quantify their performance. The results indicate that the feature-learning system, based on convolutional neural networks, significantly outperforms the classical feature-engineering based approach which uses manually engineered features and a random forest classifier. The former achieves an accuracy of 93.61 percent and the latter an accuracy of 87.25 percent.},

Analytical formulas have been derived for generating Lamb wave signals subsequently used for training and validation test of the proposed crack damage detection technique for thin metal plates. Experimental test data from aluminum plate with simulated notch damage has also been used to independently validate the CNN model.

abstract = {Delamination is the principal mode of failure of laminated composites. It is caused by the rupture of the fiber–matrix interface and results in the separation of the layers. This failure is induced by interlaminate tension and shear that is developed due to a variety of factors such as fatigue. Composites are known for excellent structural performance, which can be significantly affected by delamination. Such damages are not always visible on the surface and can lead to sudden catastrophic failures. To ensure a structural performance and integrity, accurate methods to monitor damages are required. This work presents a methodology for damage detection and identification on laminated composite plates using artificial neural networks fed with modal data obtained by finite element analysis. The proposed neural network to quantify damage severity achieved up to 95% success rate. A comparative study was done to evaluate the effect of boundary conditions on damage location. With the comparative study results, another neural network was proposed to locate damage position, achieving excellent results by successfully locating or by significantly reducing the search area. Both proposed ANNs use only frequency variation values as inputs, an easily obtainable quantity that requires few equipment to be acquired. The obtained results from these numerical examples indicate that the proposed approach can detect true damage locations and estimate damage magnitudes with satisfactory accuracy for this particular geometry, even under high measurement noise.},

Unmanned aircraft systems (UASs) offer a viable and economical alternative to a conventional sensor and platform for acquiring high spatial and high temporal resolution data with high operational flexibility. Coastal wetlands are among some of the most challenging and complex ecosystems for land cover prediction and mapping tasks because land cover targets often show high intra-class and low inter-class variances. In recent years, several deep convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures have been proposed for pixel-wise image labeling, commonly called semantic image segmentation. In this paper, some of the more recent deep CNN architectures proposed for semantic image segmentation are reviewed, and each model's training efficiency and classification performance are evaluated by training it on a limited labeled image set. Training samples are provided using the hyper-spatial resolution UAS imagery over a wetland area and the required ground truth images are prepared by manual image labeling. Experimental results demonstrate that deep CNNs have a great potential for accurate land cover prediction task using UAS hyper-spatial resolution images. Some simple deep learning architectures perform comparable or even better than complex and very deep architectures with remarkably fewer training epochs. This performance is especially valuable when limited training samples are available, which is a common case in most RS applications.},

Further, this helps to exclude overfitting of the model on training data and better predictions over unseen data. Moreover, this is the most significant strength and advantage of this approach. Also, by using this approach for validation and Levenberg-Marquardt optimizer two model layers, namely, the input layer consisting of multivariable nodes and the output layer consisting output node, will be conceptually created and validated. The internal layers will be incorporated based on the complexity of the problem. The performance of the obtained model is evaluated using the coefficient of determination.

abstract = {A physics-based approach to structural health monitoring (SHM) has practical shortcomings which restrict its suitability to simple structures under well controlled environments. With the advances in information and sensing technology (sensors and sensor networks), it has become feasible to monitor large/diverse number of parameters in complex real-world structures either continuously or intermittently by employing large in-situ (wireless) sensor networks. The availability of this historical data has engendered a lot of interest in a data-driven approach as a natural and more viable option for realizing the goal of SHM in such structures. However, the lack of sensor data corresponding to different damage scenarios continues to remain a challenge. Most of the supervised machine-learning/deep-learning techniques, when trained using this inherently limited data, lack robustness and generalizability. Physics-informed learning, which involves the integration of domain knowledge into the learning process, is presented here as a potential remedy to this challenge. As a step towards the goal of automated damage detection (mathematically an inverse problem), preliminary results are presented from dynamic modelling of beam structures using physics-informed artificial neural networks. Forward and inverse problems involving partial differential equations are solved and comparisons reveal a clear superiority of physics-informed approach over one that is purely datadriven vis-{\`{a}}-vis overfitting/generalization. Other ways of incorporating domain knowledge into the machine learning pipeline are then presented through case-studies on various aspects of NDI/SHM (visual inspection, impact diagnosis). Lastly, as the final attribute of an optimal SHM approach, a sensing paradigm for non-contact full-field measurements for damage diagnosis is presented.},

abstract = {Encoder-decoder networks are state-of-the-art approaches to biomedical image segmentation, but have two problems: i.e., the widely used pooling operations may discard spatial information, and therefore low-level semantics are lost. Feature fusion methods can mitigate these problems but feature maps of different scales cannot be easily fused because down- and upsampling change the spatial resolution of feature map. To address these issues, we propose INet, which enlarges receptive fields by increasing the kernel sizes of convolutional layers in steps (e.g., from 3times 3 to 7times 7 and then 15times 15 ) instead of downsampling. Inspired by an Inception module, INet extracts features by kernels of different sizes through concatenating the output feature maps of all preceding convolutional layers. We also find that the large kernel makes the network feasible for biomedical image segmentation. In addition, INet uses two overlapping max-poolings, i.e., max-poolings with stride 1, to extract the sharpest features. Fixed-size and fixed-channel feature maps enable INet to concatenate feature maps and add multiple shortcuts across layers. In this way, INet can recover low-level semantics by concatenating the feature maps of all preceding layers and expedite the training by adding multiple shortcuts. Because INet has additional residual shortcuts, we compare INet with a UNet system that also has residual shortcuts (ResUNet). To confirm INet as a backbone architecture for biomedical image segmentation, we implement dense connections on INet (called DenseINet) and compare it to a DenseUNet system with residual shortcuts (ResDenseUNet). INet and DenseINet require 16.9% and 37.6% fewer parameters than ResUNet and ResDenseUNet, respectively. In comparison with six encoder-decoder approaches using nine public datasets, INet and DenseINet demonstrate efficient improvements in biomedical image segmentation. INet outperforms DeepLabV3, which implementing atrous convolution instead of downsampling to increase receptive fields. INet also outperforms two recent methods (named HRNet and MS-NAS) that maintain high-resolution representations and repeatedly exchange the information across resolutions.},

abstract = {Visual understanding of complex urban street scenes is an enabling factor for a wide range of applications. Object detection has benefited enormously from large-scale datasets, especially in the context of deep learning. For semantic urban scene understanding, however, no current dataset adequately captures the complexity of real-world urban scenes. To address this, we introduce Cityscapes, a benchmark suite and large-scale dataset to train and test approaches for pixel-level and instance-level semantic labeling. Cityscapes is comprised of a large, diverse set of stereo video sequences recorded in streets from 50 different cities. 5000 of these images have high quality pixel-level annotations, 20 000 additional images have coarse annotations to enable methods that leverage large volumes of weakly-labeled data. Crucially, our effort exceeds previous attempts in terms of dataset size, annotation richness, scene variability, and complexity. Our accompanying empirical study provides an in-depth analysis of the dataset characteristics, as well as a performance evaluation of several state-of-the-art approaches based on our benchmark.},

@article{Sarkar2016,
abstract = {Structural health monitoring (SHM) is usually focused on damage detection (e.g., Yes/No) or approximate estimation of damage size. Any additional details of the damage such as configuration, shape, networking, geometrical statistics, etc., are often either ignored or significantly simplified during SHM characterization. These details, however, can be extremely important for understanding of damage severity and estimations of follow-up damage growth risk. To avoid expensive human participation and/or over-conservative SHM decisions, solutions of computational recognition for damage characterization are needed. Autonomous SHM from visual data is one of the significant challenges in the field of structural prognostics and health monitoring (PHM). The main shortcomings of the image-based PHM algorithms arise from the lack of robustness and fidelity to handle the variability of environment and nature of damage types. In recent times, deep learning has drawn huge amount of traction in the field of machine learning and visual pattern recognition due to its superior performance compared to the state-of-the-art techniques. This paper proposes to formulate and apply a deep learning technique to characterize the damage in the form of cracks on a composite material. The deep learning architecture is constructed by multi-layer neural network that is based on the fundamentals of unsupervised representational learning theory. The robustness and the accuracy of the approach is validated on an extensive set of real image data collected via applying variable load conditions on the structure. The paper has shown a high characterization accuracy over a wide range of loading conditions with limited number of labeled training image data.},

A numerical model based on the time domain spectral element method is used for modeling of Lamb wave propagation and interaction with barely visible impact damage in a carbon-epoxy laminate. Numerical studies are followed by experimental research on the same material with an impact damage induced by various energy and also a Teflon insert simulating delamination. Wavenumber adaptive image filtering and signal processing are used for damage visualization and assessment for both numerical and experimental full wavefield data. It is shown that it is possible to visualize and assess the impact damage location, size and to some extent severity by using the proposed technique.},

abstract = {One of recent trends [31, 32, 14] in network architecture design is stacking small filters (e.g., 1×1 or 3×3) in the entire network because the stacked small filters is more efficient than a large kernel, given the same computational complexity. However, in the field of semantic segmentation, where we need to perform dense per-pixel prediction, we find that the large kernel (and effective receptive field) plays an important role when we have to perform the classification and localization tasks simultaneously. Following our design principle, we propose a Global Convolutional Network to address both the classification and localization issues for the semantic segmentation. We also suggest a residual-based boundary refinement to further refine the object boundaries. Our approach achieves state-of-art performance on two public benchmarks and significantly outperforms previous results, 82.2% (vs 80.2%) on PASCAL VOC 2012 dataset and 76.9% (vs 71.8%) on Cityscapes dataset.},
