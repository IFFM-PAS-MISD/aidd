Although one of the earliest multivariate techniques, it continues to be the subject of much research, ranging from new model-based approaches to algorithmic ideas from neural networks. It is extremely versatile, with applications in many disciplines. The first edition of this book was the first comprehensive text written solely on principal component analysis. The second edition updates and substantially expands the original version, and is once again the definitive text on the subject. It includes core material, current research and a wide range of applications. Its length is nearly double that of the first edition. Researchers in statistics, or in other fields that use principal component analysis, will find that the book gives an authoritative yet accessible account of the subject. It is also a valuable resource for graduate courses in multivariate analysis. The book requires some knowledge of matrix algebra. Ian Jolliffe is Professor of Statistics at the University of Aberdeen. He is author or co-author of over 60 research papers and three other books. His research interests are broad, but aspects of principal component analysis have fascinated him and kept him busy for over 30 years.},

abstract = {<p>The widespread application of sophisticated structural health monitoring systems in civil infrastructures produces a large volume of data. As a result, the analysis and mining of structural health monitoring data have become hot research topics in the field of civil engineering. However, the harsh environment of civil structures causes the data measured by structural health monitoring systems to be contaminated by multiple anomalies, which seriously affect the data analysis results. This is one of the main barriers to automatic real-time warning, because it is difficult to distinguish the anomalies caused by structural damage from those related to incorrect data. Existing methods for data cleansing mainly focus on noise filtering, whereas the detection of incorrect data requires expertise and is very time-consuming. Inspired by the real-world manual inspection process, this article proposes a computer vision and deep learning–based data anomaly detection method. In particular, the framework of the proposed method includes two steps: data conversion by data visualization, and the construction and training of deep neural networks for anomaly classification. This process imitates human biological vision and logical thinking. In the data visualization step, the time series signals are transformed into image vectors that are plotted piecewise in grayscale images. In the second step, a training dataset consisting of randomly selected and manually labeled image vectors is input into a deep neural network or a cluster of deep neural networks, which are trained via techniques termed stacked autoencoders and greedy layer-wise training. The trained deep neural networks can be used to detect potential anomalies in large amounts of unchecked structural health monitoring data. To illustrate the training procedure and validate the performance of the proposed method, acceleration data from the structural health monitoring system of a real long-span bridge in China are employed. The results show that the multi-pattern anomalies of the data can be automatically detected with high accuracy.</p>},

abstract = {Long-term structural health monitoring (SHM) has become an important tool to ensure the safety of infrastructures. However, determining methods to extract valuable information from large amounts of data from SHM systems for effective identification of damage still remains a major challenge. This paper provides a novel effective method for structural damage detection by introduction of space and time windows in the traditional principal component analysis (PCA) technique. Numerical results with a planar beam model demonstrate that, due to the presence of space and time windows, the proposed double-window PCA method (DWPCA) has a higher sensitivity for damage identification than the previous method moving PCA (MPCA), which combines only time windows with PCA. Further studies indicate that the developed approach, as compared to the MPCA method, has a higher resolution in localizing damage by space windows and also in quantitative evaluation of damage severity. Finally, a finite-element model of a practical bridge is used to prove that the proposed DWPCA method has greater sensitivity for damage detection than traditional methods and potential for applications in practical engineering.},

abstract = {This paper provides an overview of methods to detect, locate, and characterize damage in structural and mechanical systems by examining changes in measured vibration response. Research in vibration-based damage identification has been rapidly expanding over the last few years. The basic idea behind this technology is that modal parameters (notably frequencies, mode shapes, and modal damping) are functions of the physical properties of the structure (mass, damping, and stiffness). Therefore, changes in the physical properties will cause detectable changes in the modal properties. The motivation for the development of this technology is presented. The methods are categorized according to various criteria such as the level of damage detection provided, model-based versus non-model-based methods, and linear versus nonlinear methods. The methods are also described in general terms including difficulties associated with their implementation and their fidelity. Past, current, and future-planned applications of this technology to actual engineering systems are summarized. The paper concludes with a discussion of critical issues for future research in the area of vibration-based damage identification.},

In the MDOF system, roof acceleration is estimated through the input ground motion. Various cases of noise-contaminated signals are considered in this study, and the conventional multilayer perceptron (MLP) algorithm serves as a reference for the proposed CNN approach. According to the results from numerical simulations and experimental data, the proposed CNN approach is able to predict the structural responses accurately, and it is more robust against noisy data compared with the MLP algorithm. Moreover, the physical interpretation of CNN model is discussed in the context of structural dynamics. It is demonstrated that in some special cases, the convolution kernel has the capability of approximating the numerical integration operator, and the convolution layers attempt to extract the dominant frequency signature observed in the ideal target signal while eliminating irrelevant information during the training process.},

The wave propagation data are used to determine the location and degree of damage in metallic and composite plates. The structural components are to be instrumented with array of actuators and sensors (PCB) able to excite and record its dynamic response. A damage index, calculated from the measured wave propagation data in a reference state (baseline) and the current state, is introduced as a determinant of structural damage. The index is a relative measure comparing the two states of the structure under the same ambient conditions. The damage index increase its intensity when the damage size increase too. Moreover, its calculation in different paths associated with the Artificial Neural Networks or Probability Ellipse methods allow to identify position and entity of the damage. Two panels made by aluminum and fabric composite material have been used for tests. A damage entities simulated as through-thickness hole with diameter equal to 6. mm has been investigated for aluminium panel while three damage entities (through-thickness hole with size equal to 2.5. mm, 4.5. mm and 9. mm) have been investigated for that in composite material. In order to get a training, needful for the application of the ANN method, finite elements analysis have been performed for the aluminum panel taking into account several damage paths. Simulations have been performed in order to characterize the propagation path of the Lamb waves in composite plate changing the damage entities from hole diameter equal to 2.5. mm up to 9. mm. Damage index for each damage size for both simulations and tests will be compared. The potential applications of these methods in developing health monitoring systems in defects-critical structures and in composite material structures are discussed.},

Compared with other decision tree induction techniques that are based upon recursive partitioning employing greedy searches to choose the best splitting attribute and value at each node that will necessarily miss regions of the search space, the genetic programming based approach can overcome the problem. However, the method still requires the discretization of the often continuous-valued toxicity endpoints prior to the tree induction. A novel extension of this method, YAdapt, is introduced in this work which models the original continuous endpoint by adaptively finding suitable ranges to describe the endpoints during the tree induction process, removing the need for discretization prior to tree induction and allowing the ordinal nature of the endpoint to be taken into account in the models built.},

The precursory micro-cracking activity and fracture behavior of crumb rubber concrete with different rubber contents, 0%, 10%, and 15%, were analyzed. The various acoustic emission statistical parameters including cumulative event, frequency distribution, amplitude distribution, and b-value were used for the analysis. The general fracture process is similar for all normal and crumb rubber concretes and can be divided into three distinct stages of micro-crack activity, namely, early stage, main collapse stage, and post-fracture stage. The following conclusions were drawn from the analysis: (1) more micro-cracks initiated and grew at early stage in the normal concrete, while less micro-cracks in the crumb rubber concrete but with longer stage duration; (2) the duration and crack number are both increasing with the increase in the rubber contents in main collapse and post-fracture stages; (3) new crack types associated with the rubber particles were recorded due to the change of the peak frequencies; and (4) the amplitude of the cracks decrease with the increase in the rubber content due to the damping ratio and interface improvement by the mixed rubbers. The results obtained in this article demonstrate that the acoustic emission technique can provide valuable information for a better understanding of micro-cracking and fracture monitoring of crumb rubber concrete.</p>},

abstract = {Damage detection in civil engineering constructions using the dynamic system parameters has become an important research topic. A direct, fast and inexpensive method is therefore required to evaluate and localize damage using the change in dynamic parameters between the intact and damage states. This paper investigates the application of the change in modal curvatures to detect damage in a prestressed concrete bridge. To establish the method simply supported and continuous beams containing damaged parts at different locations are tested using simulated data. Some important conclusions concerning the computation of the modal curvatures are drawn. A damage indicator called "curvature damage factor" is introduced, in which the difference in curvature mode shape for all modes can be summarized in one number for each measured point. The technique is further applied to a real structure, namely bridge Z24 which lies between the villages Koppigen and Utzenstorf and crosses the highway A1 between Bern and Zurich in Switzerland. In the framework of a Brite-Euram project, the bridge is used as a full-scale specimen and subjected to different damage scenarios in order to introduce damage. {\textcopyright} 1999 Academic Press.},

abstract = {We trained a large, deep convolutional neural network to classify the 1.2 million high-resolution images in the ImageNet LSVRC-2010 contest into the 1000 different classes. On the test data, we achieved top-1 and top-5 error rates of 37.5% and 17.0%, respectively, which is considerably better than the previous state-of-the-art. The neural network, which has 60 million parameters and 650,000 neurons, consists of five convolutional layers, some of which are followed by max-pooling layers, and three fully connected layers with a final 1000-way softmax. To make training faster, we used nonsaturating neurons and a very efficient GPU implementation of the convolution operation. To reduce overfitting in the fully connected layers we employed a recently developed regularization method called "dropout" that proved to be very effective. We also entered a variant of this model in the ILSVRC-2012 competition and achieved a winning top-5 test error rate of 15.3%, compared to 26.2% achieved by the second-best entry.},

abstract = {Backpropagation is now the most widely used tool in the field of artificial neural networks. At the core of backpropagation is a method for calculating derivatives exactly and efficiently in any large system made up of elementary subsystems or calculations which are represented by known, differentiable functions; thus, backpropagation has many applications which do not involve neural networks as such. This paper first reviews basic backpropagation, a simple method which is now being widely used in areas like pattern recognition and fault diagnosis. Next, it presents the basic equations for back-propagation through time, and discusses applications to areas like pattern recognition involving dynamic systems, systems identification, and control. Finally, it describes further extensions of this method, to deal with systems other than neural networks, systems involving simultaneous equations or true recurrent networks, and other practical issues which arise with this method. Pseudocode is provided to clarify the algorithms. The chain rule forordered derivatives—the theorem which underlies backpropagation—is briefly discussed. {\textcopyright} 1990, IEEE},

In other words, the relation between impact energy and damage detectability will be shown. A numerical model based on the time domain spectral element method is used for modeling of Lamb wave propagation and interaction with barely visible impact damage in a carbon-epoxy laminate. Numerical studies are followed by experimental research on the same material with an impact damage induced by various energy and also a Teflon insert simulating delamination. Wavenumber adaptive image filtering and signal processing are used for damage visualization and assessment for both numerical and experimental full wavefield data. It is shown that it is possible to visualize and assess the impact damage location, size and to some extent severity by using the proposed technique.},

@article{Hochreiter1997,
abstract = {Learning to store information over extended time intervals by recurrent backpropagation takes a very long time, mostly because of insufficient, decaying error backflow. We briefly review Hochreiter's (1991) analysis of this problem, then address it by introducing a novel, efficient, gradient based method called long short-term memory (LSTM). Truncating the gradient where this does not do harm, LSTM can learn to bridge minimal time lags in excess of 1000 discrete-time steps by enforcing constant error flow through constant error carousels within special units. Multiplicative gate units learn to open and close access to the constant error flow. LSTM is local in space and time; its computational complexity per time step and weight is O. 1. Our experiments with artificial data involve local, distributed, real-valued, and noisy pattern representations. In comparisons with real-time recurrent learning, back propagation through time, recurrent cascade correlation, Elman nets, and neural sequence chunking, LSTM leads to many more successful runs, and learns much faster. LSTM also solves complex, artificial long-time-lag tasks that have never been solved by previous recurrent network algorithms.},

abstract = {This study presents a convolutional neural network (CNN)-based response estimation model for structural health monitoring (SHM) of tall buildings subject to wind loads. In this model, the wind-induced responses are estimated by CNN trained with previously measured sensor signals; this enables the SHM system to operate stably even when a sensor fault or data loss occurs. In the presented model, top-level wind-induced displacement in the time and frequency domains, and wind data in the frequency domain are configured into the input map of the CNN to reflect the resisting capacity of a tall building, the change in the dynamic characteristics of the building due to wind loads, and the relationship between wind load and the building. To evaluate stress, which is used as a safety indicator for structural members in the building, the maximum and minimum strains of columns are set as the output layer of the CNN. The CNN is trained using measured wind and wind response data to predict the column strains during a future wind load. The presented model is validated using data from a wind tunnel test of a building model. The performance of the presented model is verified through strain estimation with data that were not used in the CNN training. To assess the validity of the presented input map configuration, the estimation performance is compared with a CNN that considered only the time domain responses as input. Furthermore, the effects of the variations in the configuration of the CNN on the wind response estimation performance are examined.},

abstract = {Structural health monitoring (SHM) is used worldwide for managing and maintaining civil infrastructures. SHM systems have produced huge amounts of data, but the effective monitoring, mining, and utilization of this data still need in-depth study. SHM data generally includes multiple types of anomalies caused by sensor faults or system malfunctions that can disturb structural analysis and assessment. In the routine data pre-processing, multiple signal processing techniques are required to detect the anomalies, respectively, which is inefficient. The large variations of extracted features from massive SHM data make the data anomaly detection techniques prone to be over-processed or under-processed. Even with expert intervention, the parameter tuning, associated with multiple data preprocessing methods, is still a challenge, making the procedure expensive and inefficient. In addition, one data anomaly detection technique frequently mis-detects other types of anomaly. In this work, we focus on the anomaly detection in the stage of data pre-processing that little work has been done based on the real-world continuous SHM data with multiclass anomalies. We proposed a novel data anomaly detection method based on a convolutional neural network (CNN) that imitates human vision and decision making. First, we split raw time series data into sections, and visualized the data in time and frequency domain, respectively. Then each section's images were stacked as a single dual-channel image and labeled according to graphical features (multi-2D image space expression). Second, a CNN was designed and trained for data anomaly classification, during which the descriptions and representations of the anomalies' features were learned by convolution. To validate our work, we considered the effects of balanced and imbalanced training sets and training ratios on actual acceleration data from an SHM system for a long-span cable-stayed bridge. The results show that our method could detect the multipattern anomalies of SHM data efficiently with high accuracy. The proposed dual-information CNN-based design makes this detection process readily scalable, faster, and more accurate, thereby providing a novel perspective with strong potential for SHM data preprocessing.},

The basic idea behind this technology is that modal parameters (notably frequencies, mode shapes, and modal damping) are functions of the physical properties of the structure (mass, damping, and stiffness). Therefore, changes in the physical properties will cause detectable changes in the modal properties. The motivation for the development of this technology is presented. The methods are categorized according to various criteria such as the level of damage detection provided, model-based versus non-model-based methods, and linear versus nonlinear methods. The methods are also described in general terms including difficulties associated with their implementation and their fidelity. Past, current, and future-planned applications of this technology to actual engineering systems are summarized.

Firstly, it demonstrates that Lamb wave ultrasonic tomography can be used to accurately map material loss on an exposed aircraft surface with sensors embedded on the structure's hidden surface. Hidden, in this case, refers to the surface that is not exposed to the atmosphere - the underneath of an aircraft wing, for example.

However, composite materials are prone to production defects and other defects originated during exploitation, which may jeopardize the safety of such a structure. Thus, non-destructive evaluation methods that are material-independent and suitable for a wide range of defects identification are needed. In this paper, a technique for damage characterization in composite plates is proposed. In the presented non-destructive testing method, guided waves are excited by a piezoelectric transducer, attached to tested specimens, and measured by a scanning laser Doppler vibrometer in a dense grid of points. By means of signal processing, irregularities in wavefield images caused by any material defects are extracted and used for damage characterization. The effectiveness of the proposed technique is validated on four different composite panels: Carbon fiber-reinforced polymer, glass fiber-reinforced polymer, composite reinforced by randomly-oriented short glass fibers and aluminum-honeycomb core sandwich composite. Obtained results confirm its versatility and efficacy in damage characterization in various types of composite plates.</p>},

However, traditional physics based models do not provide an accurate representation, and classic data driven techniques, such as a support vector machine, are too simplistic to capture the complex nature of ultrasonic guide waves. To address this challenge, this paper uses a deep learning interpretation of ultrasonic guided waves to achieve fast, accurate, and automated structural damaged detection. To achieve this, full wavefield scans of thin metal plates are used, half from the undamaged state and half from the damaged state. This data is used to train our deep network to predict the damage state of a plate with 99.98% accuracy given signals from just 10 spatial locations on the plate, as compared to that of a support vector machine (SVM), which achieved a 62% accuracy.},

abstract = {The process of implementing a damage identification strategy for aerospace, civil and mechanical engineering infrastructure is referred to as structural health monitoring (SHM). Here, damage is defined as changes to the material and/or geometric properties of these systems, including changes to the boundary conditions and system connectivity, which adversely affect the system's performance. A wide variety of highly effective local non-destructive evaluation tools are available for such monitoring. However, the majority of SHM research conducted over the last 30 years has attempted to identify damage in structures on a more global basis. The past 10 years have seen a rapid increase in the amount of research related to SHM as quantified by the significant escalation in papers published on this subject. The increased interest in SHM and its associated potential for significant life-safety and economic benefits has motivated the need for this theme issue. This introduction begins with a brief history of SHM technology development. Recent research has begun to recognize that the SHM problem is fundamentally one of the statistical pattern recognition (SPR) and a paradigm to address such a problem is described in detail herein as it forms the basis for organization of this theme issue. In the process of providing the historical overview and summarizing the SPR paradigm, the subsequent articles in this theme issue are cited in an effort to show how they fit into this overview of SHM. In conclusion, technical challenges that must be addressed if SHM is to gain wider application are discussed in a general manner. {\textcopyright} 2006 The Royal Society.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2018 SPIE. Many convolutional neural networks (CNN)-based approaches were proposed and applied to detect damage in various civil structures in recent years. Usually, the training process of the classical CNN requires a large number of labeled data which is from the monitored structure in undamaged and various damaged scenarios. However, it is impractical to acquire sufficient data that can be exactly labeled with damaged from the infrastructures in service as training data. Thus, we propose a novel unsupervised CNN-based approach to automatically extract optimal feature representations from the unlabeled data in a single class. In the case study, a known dataset from an undamaged scenario is used to train CNN and a dataset from an unknown scenario is used to test the trained CNN. The proposed approach in unsupervised learning is capable of extracting feature representations from the raw acceleration signals that are sensitive to the presence of damage. Then, the extracted damage-sensitive features are fed into a one-class support vector machine (OC-SVM) for novelty detection. The feature set from the undamaged dataset is taken as training dataset to train the OC-SVM, and the extracted features from the unknown dataset are used for testing. In order to verify the effectiveness of the proposed approach in structural damage localization, a number of accelerometers are used to acquire sufficient raw acceleration data from a lab-scale steel bridge, and the preliminary experimental results show that the proposed novel CNN-based approach performs very well in damage localization.},

abstract = {Structural health monitoring (SHM) and vibration-based structural damage detection have been a continuous interest for civil, mechanical and aerospace engineers over the decades. Early and meticulous damage detection has always been one of the principal objectives of SHM applications. The performance of a classical damage detection system predominantly depends on the choice of the features and the classifier. While the fixed and hand-crafted features may either be a sub-optimal choice for a particular structure or fail to achieve the same level of performance on another structure, they usually require a large computation power which may hinder their usage for real-time structural damage detection. This paper presents a novel, fast and accurate structural damage detection system using 1D Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) that has an inherent adaptive design to fuse both feature extraction and classification blocks into a single and compact learning body. The proposed method performs vibration-based damage detection and localization of the damage in real-time. The advantage of this approach is its ability to extract optimal damage-sensitive features automatically from the raw acceleration signals. Large-scale experiments conducted on a grandstand simulator revealed an outstanding performance and verified the computational efficiency of the proposed real-time damage detection method.},

abstract = {14. Sponsoring Agency Code-15. Supplementary Notes-16. Abstract Concrete cracking is a ubiquitous phenomenon, present in all types of concrete structures. Identifying and tracking the amount and severity of cracking is paramount to evaluating the current condition and predicting the future service life of a concrete asset. Concrete cracks can indicate reinforcement corrosion, the development of spalls or changing support conditions. Therefore, monitoring cracks during the life span of concrete structures has been an effective technique to evaluate the level of safety and preparing plans for future appropriate rehabilitation. One growing technique are unmanned inspections using Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV). UAVs are drones equipped with cameras, sensors, GPS, etc. RGB images (color images in Red, Green and Blue color space) are obtained from a camera mounted on a UAV flying around the structure, to detect cracks and other defects. Each image captured by UAV needs to be evaluated to track the crack formations. To save time, this task can be done by applying image processing techniques to automatically detect and report cracks rather than using a human to identify them. In addition, processing RGB images with sufficient information, such as the distance of camera to surface for each picture, will provide the dimension of the cracks (length and width).},

With the advances in information and sensing technology (sensors and sensor networks), it has become feasible to monitor large/diverse number of parameters in complex real-world structures either continuously or intermittently by employing large in-situ (wireless) sensor networks. The availability of this historical data has engendered a lot of interest in a data-driven approach as a natural and more viable option for realizing the goal of SHM in such structures. However, the lack of sensor data corresponding to different damage scenarios continues to remain a challenge. Most of the supervised machine-learning/deep-learning techniques, when trained using this inherently limited data, lack robustness and generalizability. Physics-informed learning, which involves the integration of domain knowledge into the learning process, is presented here as a potential remedy to this challenge. As a step towards the goal of automated damage detection (mathematically an inverse problem), preliminary results are presented from dynamic modelling of beam structures using physics-informed artificial neural networks. Forward and inverse problems involving partial differential equations are solved and comparisons reveal a clear superiority of physics-informed approach over one that is purely datadriven vis-{\`{a}}-vis overfitting/generalization. Other ways of incorporating domain knowledge into the machine learning pipeline are then presented through case-studies on various aspects of NDI/SHM (visual inspection, impact diagnosis). Lastly, as the final attribute of an optimal SHM approach, a sensing paradigm for non-contact full-field measurements for damage diagnosis is presented.},

abstract = {Recent developments tools and techniques for structural health monitoring allow the design of early warning systems for the damage diagnosis and structural assessment. Most methods to damage detection involve vibration data analysis by using identification systems that generally require a mathematical model and much information about the system, such as parameters and states that are mostly unknown. In this paper, a novel frequency domain convolutional neural network (FDCNN) proposed aims to design an identification system for damage detection based on Bouc–Wen hysteretic model. FDCNN, unlike other works, only requires acceleration measurements for damage diagnosis that are very sensitive to environmental noise. In contrast to neural network (NN) and time domain convolutional neural network, FDCNN reduces the computational time required for the learning stage and adds robustness against noise in data. The FDCNN includes random filters in the frequency domain to avoid measurement noise using a spectral pooling operation, which is useful when the system bandwidth is unknown. Incorrect filtering can produce unwanted results, as a shifted and attenuation signal relative to the original. Moreover, FDCNN allows overcoming the parameterization problem in nonlinear systems, which is often difficult to achieve. In order to validate the proposed methodology, a comparison between two different architectures of convolutional neural networks is made, showing that proposed CNN in frequency domain brings better performance in the identification system for damage diagnosis in building structures. Experimental results from reducing scale two-storey building confirm the effectiveness of the proposed.},

abstract = {<p>Condition-based maintenance refers to the installation of permanent sensors on a structure/system. By means of early fault detection, severe damage can be avoided, allowing efficient timing of maintenance works and avoiding unnecessary inspections at the same time. These are the goals for structural health monitoring (SHM). The changes caused by incipient damage on raw data collected by sensors are quite small, and are usually contaminated by noise and varying environmental factors, so the algorithms used to extract information from sensor data need to focus on sensitive damage features. The developments of SHM techniques over the last 20 years have been more related to algorithm improvements than to sensor progress, which essentially have been maintained without major conceptual changes (with regards to accelerometers, piezoelectric wafers, and fiber optic sensors). The main different SHM systems (vibration methods, strain-based fiber optics methods, guided waves, acoustic emission, and nanoparticle-doped resins) are reviewed, and the main issues to be solved are identified. Reliability is the key question, and can only be demonstrated through a probability of detection (POD) analysis. Attention has only been paid to this issue over the last ten years, but now it is a growing trend. Simulation of the SHM system is needed in order to reduce the number of experiments.</p>},

@article{Ismail2009,
abstract = {Structural systems often show nonlinear behavior under severe excitations generated by natural hazards. In that condition, the restoring force becomes highly nonlinear showing significant hysteresis. The hereditary nature of this nonlinear restoring force indicates that the force cannot be described as a function of the instantaneous displacement and velocity. Accordingly, many hysteretic restoring force models were developed to include the time dependent nature using a set of differential equations. This survey contains a review of the past, recent developments and implementations of the Bouc-Wen model which is used extensively in modeling the hysteresis phenomenon in the dynamically excited nonlinear structures. {\textcopyright} CIMNE, Barcelona, Spain 2009.},

@article{Ijjeh2021,
abstract = {A novel full wavefield processing method by using fully convolutional neural networks is presented. The full wavefield of propagating Lamb waves in the fibre-reinforced composite plate was simulated by the parallel spectral element method. It resembles a full wavefield measurements acquired on a surface of the plate by the scanning laser Doppler vibrometer. The aim of the proposed technique is an identification of delamination location, size and shape. It is achieved by pixel-wise image segmentation by using the end-to-end approach. It is possible because of the large dataset of Lamb wave propagation patterns resulting from interaction with delaminations of random location, size and shape. It is demonstrated that the proposed method, tested on numerical data, is performing better than conventional adaptive wavenumber filtering method which was developed in previous work. Moreover, it enables better automation of delamination identification so that the damage map can be created without user intervention. The method was also tested on experimental data acquired on the surface of the specimen in which delamination was artificially created by a Teflon insert. The obtained results with the deep learning approach show its capability to predict the delamination in the numerically generated dataset with high accuracy compared to the conventional damage detection approach. Furthermore, the deep learning model shows the ability to generalize to a further experiential set.},

It presents a case study of damage detection in a curved carbon-fibre reinforced panel with two omega stiffeners which was investigated using ultrasonic Lamb waves. The statistical technique of outlier analysis was used here as a way of pre-processing experimental data prior to damage classification. Multilayer perceptron neural networks were used here for both classification and regression problems of damage detection. It was then investigated whether using wavelet analysis to perform prior wavelet decompositions of experimental data could facilitate damage classification. {\textcopyright} Journal compilation {\textcopyright} 2008 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

@article{Figueiredo2011,
abstract = {The goal of this article is to detect structural damage in the presence of operational and environmental variations using vibration-based damage identification procedures. For this purpose, four machine learning algorithms are applied based on the auto-associative neural network, factor analysis, Mahalanobis distance, and singular value decomposition. A base-excited three-story frame structure was tested in laboratory environment to obtain time-series data from an array of accelerometers under several structural state conditions. Tests were performed with varying stiffness and mass conditions with the assumption that these sources of variability are representative of changing operational and environmental conditions. Damage is simulated through nonlinear effects introduced by a bumper mechanism that induces a repetitive, impact-type nonlinearity. This mechanism intends to simulate the cracks that open and close under dynamic loads or loose connections that rattle. The unique contribution of this study is a direct comparison of the four proposed machine learning algorithms that have been reported as reliable approaches to separate structural conditions with changes resulting from damage from changes caused by operational and environmental variations. {\textcopyright} The Author(s) 2010.},

abstract = {Nondestructive evaluation (NDE) utilizes a variety of techniques to inspect various materials for defects without causing changes to the material. X-ray computed tomography (CT) produces large volumes of three dimensional image data. Using the task of identifying delaminations in carbon fiber reinforced polymer (CFRP) composite CT, this work shows that it is possible to automate the analysis of these large volumes of CT data using a machine learning model known as a convolutional neural network (CNN). Further, tests on simulated data sets show that with a robust set of experimental data, it may be possible to go beyond just identification and instead accurately characterize the size and shape of the delaminations with CNNs.},
