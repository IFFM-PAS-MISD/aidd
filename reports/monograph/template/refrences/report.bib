The damage of composite structures caused by impact events is one of the most critical behaviours that inhibits more widespread application of composite material. It is important to study and understand the damage mechanism in order to produce effective designs for composite structures. The aerospace industry is one of the industries that uses composite material widely in its structures. The failure caused by impact damage will contribute to unexpected scenarios. This paper discusses damage in composite material, impact in composite material, classification of impact, impact response, high velocity impact, energy absorption and impact force of composites, and modes of failure.},

abstract = {This chapter presents an experimental investigation using high-velocity impact and low-velocity impact testing to detect and quantify impact damage for glass fiber-reinforced polymer (GFRP) type C-glass/Epoxy 600 g/m2 and type E-glass/Epoxy 800 g/m2 plate. GFRP type C-glass/Epoxy 600 g/m2 and type E-glass/Epoxy 800 g/m2 plates were tested using a single-stage gas gun and drop weight tester. For high-velocity impact, this research investigated the effect of specimen thickness, the type of projectiles, and the impact velocity, whereas for low-velocity impact, this research investigated the effects of specimen thickness based on the number of plies, and impact energy on the failure modes of GFRP type C-glass/Epoxy 600 g/m2 and type E-glass/Epoxy 800 g/m2 using nondestructive testing. The experimental results of the high-velocity impact test showed that both types of GFRP exhibited damage in terms of fiber cracking and fiber pull out, after being tested with four different gas gun pressures. For low-velocity impact tests, the results showed that both types of GFRP exhibited fiber crack and matrix crack. Most of the impacted specimens showed that GFRP type E-glass/Epoxy 800 g/m2 experienced a smaller damage area compared to type C-glass/Epoxy 600 g/m2. From the tests, the effect of the shape of the projectile, the target thickness, the gas gun pressure, and the impact energy on the performance of GFRP were determined. It can be concluded that GFRP type E-glass/Epoxy 800 g/m2 is stronger than GFRP type C-glass/Epoxy 600 g/m2 since it has more fiber volume as it is higher in density and has good mechanical properties. Therefore, GFRP type E-glass/Epoxy 800 g/m2 is recommended to be used in aircraft structure applications.},

Performing primary experiments to find the relationship between AE parameters and damage mechanisms, the AE signals of obtained clusters were assigned to distinct damage mechanisms. Also, the dominance of damage mechanisms was determined based on the distribution of AE signals in different clusters. Finally SEM observation was employed to verify obtained results.

abstract = {Acoustic Emission (AE) can be used to discriminate the different types of damage occurring in a constrained composite. However, the main problem associated with data analysis is the discrimination between the different acoustic emission sources. The objective of the cluster analysis is to separate a set of data into several classes that reflect the internal structure of the data. Indeed, cluster analysis is an important tool for investigating and interpreting data. In this paper we use two kinds of classifiers: a supervised classifier and also an unsupervised one (Kohonen's map). We combine two techniques: the k-means algorithm and the k nearest neighbours. Glass/polyester model specimens were used for the validation of the proposed methodology. We worked on polyester resin and glass/polyester unidirectional specimens, subjected to tensile loading within different configurations, awaiting preferential damage modes in the material. Moreover, single fibre composites have been tested to produce fibre breakage acoustic emission events under conditions closely approximating those encountered in a real composite. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Guided wave structural health monitoring uses sparse sensor networks embedded in sophisticated structures for defect detection and characterization. The biggest challenge of those sensor networks is developing robust techniques for reliable damage detection under changing environmental and operating conditions (EOC). To address this challenge, we develop a novelty classifier for damage detection based on one class support vector machines. We identify appropriate features for damage detection and introduce a feature aggregation method which quadratically increases the number of available training observations. We adopt a two-level voting scheme by using an ensemble of classifiers and predictions. Each classifier is trained on a different segment of the guided wave signal, and each classifier makes an ensemble of predictions based on a single observation. Using this approach, the classifier can be trained using a small number of baseline signals. We study the performance using Monte-Carlo simulations of an analytical model and data from impact damage experiments on a glass fiber composite plate. We also demonstrate the classifier performance using two types of baseline signals: fixed and rolling baseline training set. The former requires prior knowledge of baseline signals from all EOC, while the latter does not and leverages the fact that EOC vary slowly over time and can be modeled as a Gaussian process.},

abstract = {For many engineering and aerospace applications, detection and quantification of multiscale damage in fiberreinforced composite structures is increasing in importance. Consequently, the development of an efficient and costeffective diagnosis scheme that can accurately sense, characterize, and evaluate the existence of any form of damage will offer significant potential for improving the performance, reliability, and extending the operational life of these complex systems. We present an approach to characterize and classify different damage states in composite laminates by measuring the change in the signature of the resultant wave that propagates through the anisotropic media under forced excitation. The wave propagation is measured using surface-mounted piezoelectric transducers. Sensor signals collected from test specimens with various forms of induced damage are analyzed using a patternrecognition algorithm known as the one-class support vector machines. The one-class support-vector-machine algorithm performs automatic anomaly detection and classification of damage signatures using various features from the sensor readings. The results obtained suggest that the one-class support-vector-machine algorithm, along with appropriate preprocessing techniques, can often achieve better accuracy than the popular k-nearest-neighbor method in detecting and classifying anomalies caused by structural defects, even when the perturbations caused in the sensor signals due to different damage states are minimal.

abstract = {Ultrasonic wavefield imaging with a non-contact technology can provide detailed information about the health status of an inspected structure. However, high spatial resolution, often necessary for accurate damage quantification, typically demands a long scanning time. In this work, we investigate a novel methodology to acquire high-resolution wavefields with a reduced number of measurement points to minimize the acquisition time. Such methodology is based on the combination of compressive sensing and convolutional neural networks to recover high spatial frequency information from low-resolution images. A data set was built from 652 wavefield images acquired with a laser Doppler vibrometer describing guided ultrasonic wave propagation in eight different structures, with and without various simulated defects. Out of those 652 images, 326 cases without defect and 326 cases with defect were used as a training database for the convolutional neural network. In addition, 273 wavefield images were used as a testing database to validate the proposed methodology. For quantitative evaluation, two image quality metrics were calculated and compared to those achieved with different recovery methods or by training the convolutional neural network with non-wavefield images data set. The results demonstrate the capability of the technique for enhancing image resolution and quality, as well as similarity to the wavefield acquired on the full high-resolution grid of scan points, while reducing the number of measurement points down to 10{\%} of the number of scan points for a full grid.},

abstract = {One of the most important tasks in structural health monitoring corresponds to damage detection. In this task, the existence of damage should be determined. In the literature, several potentially useful techniques for damage detection can be found, and their applicability to a particular situation depends on the size of the critical damages that are admissible in the structure. Almost all of these techniques follow the same general procedure: the structure is excited using actuators, and the dynamical response is sensed at different locations throughout the structure. Any damage will change this vibrational response. The state of the structure is diagnosed by means of the processing of these data. Several studies have shown that the detection of changes in a structure depends on the distance from the damage to the actuator as well as the configuration of the sensor network. In this article, the authors considered the advantage of using an active piezoelectric system, where the lead zirconate titanate transducers are used as actuator and sensors in different actuation phases. In each actuation phase of the diagnosis procedure, one lead zirconate titanate transducer is used as actuator (a known electrical signal is applied), and the others are used as sensors (collecting the wave propagated through the structure at different points). An initial baseline model for undamaged structure is built applying principal component analysis to the data collected by several experiments and after the current structure (damaged or not) is subjected to the same experiments, and the collected data are projected into the principal component analysis models. Two of these projections and four damage indices (T 2-statistic, Q-statistic, combined index, and I 2 index) by each actuation phase are used to determine the presence of damages and to distinguish between them. These indices are calculated based on the analysis of the residual data matrix to represent the variability of the data projected within the residual subspace and the new space of the principal components. To validate the approach, data from two aeronautical structures - an aircraft skin panel and an aircraft turbine blade - are used.},

The principal goal for SHM is oriented to the development of efficient methodologies to process these data and provide results associated with the different levels of the damage identification process. As a contribution, this work presents a damage detection and classification methodology which includes the use of data collected from a structure under different structural states by means of a piezoelectric sensor network taking advantage of the use of guided waves, hierarchical nonlinear principal component analysis (h-NLPCA), and machine learning. The methodology is evaluated and tested in two structures: (i) a carbon fibre reinforced polymer (CFRP) sandwich structure with some damages on the multilayered composite sandwich structure and (ii) a CFRP composite plate. Damages in the structures were intentionally produced to simulate different damage mechanisms, that is, delamination and cracking of the skin.},

abstract = {Structural health monitoring has received remarkable attention due to the arising structural safety problems. Most of these structural health problems are accumulative damages such as slight changes in structural deformations which are very hard to be detected. In addition, the complexity of real structure and environmental noises make structural health monitoring more difficult. Existing methods largely use various types of sensors to collect useful parameters and then train a machine learning model to diagnose damage level and location, in which a large amount of training data are needed for the model training, while the labeled data are rare in the real world. To overcome this problem, sparse coding is employed in this paper to achieve structural health monitoring of a bridge equipped with a wireless sensor network, so that a large amount of unlabeled examples can be used to train a feature extractor based on the sparse coding algorithm. Features learned from sparse coding are then used to train a neural network classifier to distinguish different statuses of the bridge. Experimental results show the sparse coding-based deep learning algorithm achieves higher accuracy for structural health monitoring under the same level of environmental noises, compared with some existing methods.},

abstract = {Structural health monitoring (SHM) is usually focused on damage detection (e.g., Yes/No) or approximate estimation of damage size. Any additional details of the damage such as configuration, shape, networking, geometrical statistics, etc., are often either ignored or significantly simplified during SHM characterization. These details, however, can be extremely important for understanding of damage severity and estimations of follow-up damage growth risk. To avoid expensive human participation and/or over-conservative SHM decisions, solutions of computational recognition for damage characterization are needed. Autonomous SHM from visual data is one of the significant challenges in the field of structural prognostics and health monitoring (PHM). The main shortcomings of the image-based PHM algorithms arise from the lack of robustness and fidelity to handle the variability of environment and nature of damage types. In recent times, deep learning has drawn huge amount of traction in the field of machine learning and visual pattern recognition due to its superior performance compared to the state-of-the-art techniques. This paper proposes to formulate and apply a deep learning technique to characterize the damage in the form of cracks on a composite material. The deep learning architecture is constructed by multi-layer neural network that is based on the fundamentals of unsupervised representational learning theory. The robustness and the accuracy of the approach is validated on an extensive set of real image data collected via applying variable load conditions on the structure. The paper has shown a high characterization accuracy over a wide range of loading conditions with limited number of labeled training image data.},

Different information about the state of the structure can be obtained in the process, among them, detection, localization and classification of damages are mainly studied in order to avoid unnecessary maintenance procedures in civilian and military structures in several applications. To carry out SHM in prac- tice, two different approaches are used, the first is based on modelling which requires to build a very detailed model of the structure, while the second is by means of data-driven approaches which use information collected from the structure under different struc- tural states and perform an analysis by means of data analysis . For the latter, statisti- cal analysis and pattern recognition have demonstrated its effectiveness in the damage identification process because real information is obtained from the structure through sensors installed permanently to the observed object allowing a real-time monitoring. This chapter describes a damage detection and classification methodology, which makes use of a piezoelectric active system which works in several actuation phases and that is attached to the structure under evaluation, principal component analysis, and machine learning algorithms working as a pattern recognition methodology. In the chapter, the description of the developed approach and the results when it is tested in one aluminum plate are also included. Keywords:},

abstract = {We propose V2CNet, a new deep learning framework to automatically translate the demonstration videos to commands that can be directly used in robotic applications. Our V2CNet has two branches and aims at understanding the demonstration video in a fine-grained manner. The first branch has the encoder-decoder architecture to encode the visual features and sequentially generate the output words as a command, while the second branch uses a Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN) to learn the fine-grained actions. By jointly training both branches, the network is able to model the sequential information of the command, while effectively encodes the fine-grained actions. The experimental results on our new large-scale dataset show that V2CNet outperforms recent state-of-the-art methods by a substantial margin, while its output can be applied in real robotic applications. The source code and trained models will be made available.},

abstract = {A number of image processing techniques (IPTs) have been implemented for detecting civil infrastructure defects to partially replace human-conducted onsite inspections. These IPTs are primarily used to manipulate images to extract defect features, such as cracks in concrete and steel surfaces. However, the extensively varying real-world situations (e.g., lighting and shadow changes) can lead to challenges to the wide adoption of IPTs. To overcome these challenges, this article proposes a vision-based method using a deep architecture of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for detecting concrete cracks without calculating the defect features. As CNNs are capable of learning image features automatically, the proposed method works without the conjugation of IPTs for extracting features. The designed CNN is trained on 40 K images of 256 × 256 pixel resolutions and, consequently, records with about 98{\%} accuracy. The trained CNN is combined with a sliding window technique to scan any image size larger than 256 × 256 pixel resolutions. The robustness and adaptability of the proposed approach are tested on 55 images of 5,888 × 3,584 pixel resolutions taken from a different structure which is not used for training and validation processes under various conditions (e.g., strong light spot, shadows, and very thin cracks). Comparative studies are conducted to examine the performance of the proposed CNN using traditional Canny and Sobel edge detection methods. The results show that the proposed method shows quite better performances and can indeed find concrete cracks in realistic situations.},

abstract = {Damage diagnosis has been a challenging inverse problem in structural health monitoring. The main difficulty is characterizing the unknown relation between the measurements and damage patterns (i.e., damage indicator selection). Such damage indicators would ideally be able to identify the existence, location, and severity of damage. Therefore, this procedure requires complex data processing algorithms and dense sensor arrays, which brings computational intensity with it. To address this limitation, this paper introduces convolutional neural network (CNN), which is one of the major breakthroughs in image recognition, to the damage detection and localization problem. The CNN technique has the ability to discover abstract features and complex classifier boundaries that are able to distinguish various attributes of the problem. In this paper, a CNN topology was designed to classify simulated damaged and healthy cases and localize the damage when it exists. The performance of the proposed technique was evaluated through the finite-element simulations of undamaged and damaged structural connections. Samples were trained by using strain distributions as a consequence of various loads with several different crack scenarios. Completely new damage setups were introduced to the model during the testing process. Based on the findings of the proposed study, the damage diagnosis and localization were achieved with high accuracy, robustness, and computational efficiency.},

Yet, these methods require a considerable amount of time to acquire full wavefield data. Therefore, there is a significant need to reduce acquisition time. In this preliminary work, we present a transfer learning approach for reducing the number of sampled measurements necessary. Our method utilizes numerical simula- tions, combined with a small number of spatially sampled random measurements from an experimental structure, to reconstruct full wavefield data. Specifically, we use an autoencoder neural network to learn low-dimensional representations of wave propagation from numerical simulations. We then input a few experimental measurements into the neural network to reconstruct full wave- field data. To demonstrate the ability of our framework, we show our initial success in three scenarios. We show reconstruction accuracies of 86{\%} with one-fourth of the total measurements.},

Short Time Fourier Transform (STFT) is employed to transform the transient responses into two-dimensional spectral frame representation. A convolutional neural network is incorporated to distinguish between the damaged and undamaged states, as well as various types of damage of the laminated composites, by automatically extracting discriminative features from the vibration-based spectrograms. The CNN showed a classification accuracy of 90.1{\%} on one healthy and 12 delaminated cases. The study of the confusion matrix of CNN provided further insights into the physics of the problem. The predictive performance of a pre-trained CNN classifier was also evaluated on unseen cases of delamination, and physically consistent results were obtained.},

We have developed an optimized laser ultrasonic imaging system, which consists of a rapid pulsed laser scanning unit for ultrasonic generation and a laser Doppler vibrometer (LDV) unit for ultrasonic reception. CFRP laminates were subjected to low-velocity impact to introduce barely visible impact damage. In order to improve the signal-to-noise ratio of the detected ultrasonic signal, retroreflective tape and a signal averaging process were used. We thus successfully visualized the propagation of the pulsed Lamb A0 mode in the CFRP laminates without contact. Interactions between the Lamb waves and impact damage were clearly observed and the damage was easily detected through the change in wave propagation. Furthermore, we demonstrated that the damage could be rapidly detected without signal averaging. This method has significant advantages in detecting damage compared to the conventional method using a contact resonant ultrasonic transducer due to the absence of the ringing phenomenon when using the LDV.},

abstract = {A neural network model for a mechanism of visual pattern recognition is proposed in this paper. The network is self-organized by "learning without a teacher", and acquires an ability to recognize stimulus patterns based on the geometrical similarity (Gestalt) of their shapes without affected by their positions. This network is given a nickname "neocognitron". After completion of self-organization, the network has a structure similar to the hierarchy model of the visual nervous system proposed by Hubel and Wiesel. The network consits of an input layer (photoreceptor array) followed by a cascade connection of a number of modular structures, each of which is composed of two layers of cells connected in a cascade. The first layer of each module consists of "S-cells", which show characteristics similar to simple cells or lower order hypercomplex cells, and the second layer consists of "C-cells" similar to complex cells or higher order hypercomplex cells. The afferent synapses to each S-cell have plasticity and are modifiable. The network has an ability of unsupervised learning: We do not need any "teacher" during the process of self-organization, and it is only needed to present a set of stimulus patterns repeatedly to the input layer of the network. The network has been simulated on a digital computer. After repetitive presentation of a set of stimulus patterns, each stimulus pattern has become to elicit an output only from one of the C-cell of the last layer, and conversely, this C-cell has become selectively responsive only to that stimulus pattern. That is, none of the C-cells of the last layer responds to more than one stimulus pattern. The response of the C-cells of the last layer is not affected by the pattern's position at all. Neither is it affected by a small change in shape nor in size of the stimulus pattern. {\textcopyright} 1980 Springer-Verlag.},

In the this article, we present our studies on Lamb wave propagation characterization and crack detection using a hybrid lead zirconate titanate (PZT)-laser vibrometer system and frequency-wave number analysis. A scanning laser Doppler vibrometer is used to acquiring high-resolution time-space Lamb wavefield excited by a PZT actuator. The recorded wavefield is then transformed to frequency-wave number domain by two-dimensional Fourier transform. Wave spectrum in the frequency-wave number domain shows clear distinction among Lamb wave modes being present. These concepts are illustrated through several experimental tests. However, the space information is lost during this transformation. A short-space two-dimensional Fourier transform is then adopted to obtain the frequency-wave number spectra at various spatial locations, resulting in the space-frequency-wave number representation, which can show how the frequency-wave number component varies with respect to space dimension. It provides a means to study the wave propagation from the perspective of wave number domain. The space-frequency-wave number analysis has successfully been used for the study of wave interaction with structural discontinuity and crack detection on an aluminum plate. {\textcopyright} The Author(s) 2013.},

Therefore, changes in the physical properties will cause detectable changes in the modal properties. The motivation for the development of this technology is presented. The methods are categorized according to various criteria such as the level of damage detection provided, model-based versus non-model-based methods, and linear versus nonlinear methods. The methods are also described in general terms including difficulties associated with their implementation and their fidelity. Past, current, and future-planned applications of this technology to actual engineering systems are summarized.

Experimental results are presented for the application of Lamb wave techniques to quasi-isotropic graphite/epoxy test specimens containing representative damage modes, including delamination, transverse ply cracks and through-holes. Linear wave scans were performed on narrow laminated specimens and sandwich beams with various cores by monitoring the transmitted waves with piezoceramic sensors. Optimal actuator and sensor configurations were devised through experimentation, and various types of driving signal were explored. These experiments provided a procedure capable of easily and accurately determining the time of flight of a Lamb wave pulse between an actuator and sensor. Lamb wave techniques provide more information about damage presence and severity than previously tested methods (frequency response techniques), and provide the possibility of determining damage location due to their local response nature. These methods may prove suitable for structural health monitoring applications since they travel long distances and can be applied with conformable piezoelectric actuators and sensors that require little power.},

abstract = {A method for damage localization based on the phased array idea has been developed. Four arrays of transducers are used to perform a beam-forming procedure. Each array consists of nine transducers placed along a line, which are able to excite and register elastic waves. The A0 Lamb wave mode has been chosen for the localization method. The arrays are placed in such a way that the angular difference between them is 45° and the rotation point is the middle transducer, which is common for all the arrays. The idea has been tested on a square aluminium plate modeled by the Spectral Element Method. Two types of damage were considered, namely distributed damage, which was modeled as stiffness reduction, and cracks, modeled as separation of nodes between selected spectral elements. The plate is excited by a wave packet. The whole array system is placed in the middle of the plate. Each linear phased array in the system acts independently and produces maps of a scanned field based on the beam-forming procedure. These maps are made of time signals (transferred to space domain) that represent the difference between the damaged plate signals and those from the intact plate. An algorithm was developed to join all four maps. The final map is modified by proposed signal processing algorithm to indicate the damaged area of the plate more precisely. The problem for damage localization was investigated and exemplary maps confirming the effectiveness of the proposed system were obtained. It was also shown that the response of the introduced configuration removes the ambiguity of damage localization normally present when a linear phased array is utilized. The investigation is based exclusively on numerical data. {\textcopyright} SAGE Publications 2009.},

abstract = {Omni-directional guided wave array transducers contain a circular pattern of elements that individually behave as omni-directional point transmitters or receivers. The data set acquired from such an array contains time-domain signals from each permutation of transmitter and receiver. A phased addition algorithm is developed that allows an omni-directional, B-scan image of the surrounding plate to be synthesized from any geometry of array. Numerically simulated data from a single reflector is used to test the performance of the algorithm. The results from an array containing a fully populated circular area of elements (Type I array) are found to be good, but those from an array containing a single ring of elements (Type II array) contain many large side-lobes. An enhancement to the basic-phased addition algorithm is presented that uses deconvolution to suppress these side-lobes. The deconvolution algorithm enables a Type II array to equal the performance of a Type I array of the same overall diameter. The effect of diameter on angular resolution is investigated. Experimental data obtained from a guided wave array containing electromagnetic acoustic transducers (EMAT) elements for exciting and detecting the S0 Lamb wave mode in a 5-mm thick aluminium plate are processed with both algorithms and the results are discussed.},

abstract = {Piezoelectric wafer active sensors (PWAS) are inexpensive, non-intrusive un-obtrusive devices that can be surface-mounted on existing structures, or inserted in a new composite structure. The PWAS can be used in both active and passive modes. In active mode, the PWAS generate Lamb waves that can exist as either traveling waves or standing waves. As traveling waves, PWAS-generated Lamb waves can be used with the pitch-catch, pulse-echo, or phased-array methods that arrow far-field and some medium-field damage detection. As standing waves, PWAS-generated Lamb waves can used in conjunction with the electro-mechanical (E/M) impedance technique that allows near field and some medium-field damage detection. This paper presents new results obtained in the use of PWAS for the structural health monitoring of aerospace vehicles. One set of results to be presented will refer to experiments performed on detection the crack propagation in a fracture-mechanics panel with a stress-concentration precrack in the center. The crack was propagated using cyclic fatigue loading in a large testing machine. The crack was imaged with the PWAS EUSR method, which is the guided Lamb wave equivalent of the P-wave C-scan, only that it is produced from a single location and does not need a raster x-y coverage like the conventional P-wave C-scan. PWAS EUSR measurements were taken while the testing machine was running, thus simulating in-service monitoring conditions. Another set of results refers to the PWAS monitoring of disbonds in an spacecraft panel. The E/M impedance technique is shown to distinguish clearly between a bonded and disbonded part. The E/M impedance of bonded part measured at different locations is shown to be consistently the same, with the actual curves overlapping, thus confirming that the impedance changes noticed at the disbonded location are solely due to disbonding.},

abstract = {The Lamb wave-based structural damage detection technique is widely viewed as one of the most encouraging tools for structural health monitoring. However, the propagation of Lamb waves is complicated. Damage-scattering components in the sensing signals may easily be mixed with the waves that come from the source and those reflected from boundaries. Traditionally, damage scattering signals are obtained by comparing test data with a baseline data. However, such a process is affected easily by environmental and operational variability. Major emphases of the research in this article are on developing a baseline-free damage diagnosis technique based on time reversal theory. First, the propagation of the Lamb wave and its time reversal process are discussed. Second, time window functions and improved piezoelectric actuators/sensors array arrangement are developed to separate the scattered signals from the sensing signals. A time reversal imaging method is also adopted to detect and show the damages. This method makes all the scattered signals focus at the corresponding sources so that damages can be revealed. The validity of the proposed method is demonstrated through experiment in which a quasi-isotropic composite plate with PZT array is successfully monitored without relying on any past baseline data.},

Such an approach enables one to obtain better damage localisation results than in the case of utilizing all possible of excitation-sensing combinations between transducers. In this paper an algorithm for damage localisation for a rectangular panel made of aluminium alloy has been presented. The algorithm was based on the principles of elastic wave propagation which takes advantage of the fact that any structural discontinuities result in changes in the propagation of elastic waves. These changes can be registered by piezoelectric transducers and next used by damage localisation algorithms. Elastic waves can be generated and registered using piezoelectric transducers which are very light and thin. Such transducers can be very simply attached to metallic or embedded into composite structural elements to be monitored. The proposed algorithm of damage localisation uses a network of transducers that are uniformly distributed over the area of an isotropic panel. The transducers are placed on the structure using triangulation process. After acquisition signals are processed and filtered in order to remove all high and low frequency noise. Application of the damage localisation algorithm in the case of the filtered signals results in damage influence maps.},

abstract = {In this work a problem of damage detection and localization was investigated. A new configuration of piezoelectric transducers was proposed. It consists of twelve transducers. It is in a form of an equilateral triangle that has a 2×2 transducer array in each vertex. Transducers of this configuration were used to excite and register guided waves in an aluminum alloy specimen. Due to known sensitivity of these waves to structural defects it was assumed that registered waves, in the form of voltage signals, carry information about the structure condition. A special algorithm was implemented to process these signals and extract features related to damage. This algorithm transfers information from the time domain to the spatial domain. Results are mapped into coordinate system assigned to monitored structure. In this way in the case of damage present outside or inside the configuration its coordinates are highlighted. In order to detect damage on the direct path between triangle vertices a damage index is defined that indicates whether there is damage present or not. Experimental investigation included three scenarios, one for outside and one for inside localization and one for direct path detection. Results showed that this method has a potential for Structural Health Monitoring of a structure made of an isotropic material. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

The ACT generates ultrasonic pressure incident upon the surface of the plate. The pressure waves are partially refracted into the plate. The LDV is employed to measure the out-of-plane velocity of the excited Lamb wave mode at some distances where the Lamb waves are formed in the plate. The influence of the ACT angle of incidence on Lamb wave excitation is investigated and Snell's law is used to directly compute Lamb wave dispersion curves including phase and group velocity dispersion curves in aluminum plates from incident angles found to generate optimal A{\textless}inf{\textgreater}0{\textless}/inf{\textgreater} Lamb wave mode. The measured curves are compared to results obtained from a two-dimensional (2-D) Fast Fourier transform (FFT), Morlet wavelet transform (MWT) and theoretical predictions. It was concluded that the experimental results obtained using Snell's law concept are well in accordance with the theoretical solutions. The high degree of accuracy in the measured data with the theoretical results proved a high sensitivity of the air-coupled and laser ultrasound in characterizing Lamb wave dispersion in plate-like structures. The proposed non-contact hybrid system can effectively characterize the dispersive relation without knowledge of neither the materials characteristics nor the mathematical model.},

abstract = {A technique for the analysis of full wavefield data in the wavenumber/frequency domain is presented as an effective tool for damage detection, visualization and characterization. Full wavefield data contain a wealth of information regarding the space and time variation of propagating waves in damaged structural components. Such information can be used to evaluate the response spectrum in the frequency/wavenumber domain, which effectively separates incident waves from reflections caused by discontinuities encountered along the wave paths. This allows removing the injected wave from the overall response through simple filtering strategies, thus highlighting the presence of reflections associated to damage. The concept is first illustrated on analytical and numerically simulated data, and then tested on experimental results. In the experiments, full wavefield measurements are conveniently obtained using a Scanning Laser Doppler Vibrometer, which allows the detection of displacements and/or velocities over a user-defined grid, and it is able to provide the required spatial and time information in a timely manner. Tests performed on an aluminum plate with artificially seeded slits simulating longitudinal cracks show the effectiveness of the technique and its potential for application to the inspection of a variety of structural components.},

Advances in computers and digital imaging technology have allowed 3D digital image correlation (DIC) methods to measure the shape and deformation of a vibrating structure. This technique allows for full-field measurement of structural response, thus providing a wealth of simultaneous test data. This paper presents some preliminary results for the test/analysis/correlation of data measured using the DIC approach along with traditional accelerometers and a scanning laser vibrometer for comparison to a finite element model. The results indicate that all three approaches correlated well with the finite element model and provide validation for the DIC approach for full-field vibration measurement.

Alternatively, in the frequency domain, the LDV output is a line spectrum, with sidebands centred on the excitation frequency and spaced at the scan frequency. The sideband amplitudes give series coefficients for the mode shape defined along the scan line - Fourier coefficients for a circular scan or, via a simple transform, polynomial coefficients for a sinusoidal straight line or area scan. Useful measurements can also be made, directed at a single point on a structure: a small-diameter circular scan will give the angular vibration of the structure at the centre of the circle; a conical scan, produced with a short-focus lens, will measure the translational vibration at the point of focus, in magnitude and direction.},

A novel strategy based on Lamb wave focusing is proposed in order to increase damage imaging resolution. In the proposed method all actuators are used at the same time exciting specially designed waveforms so that inspect one specific point of the structure. Damage map is created by applying appropriate signal processing. It uses dispersion curve of selected Lamb wave mode for dispersion compensation. The dispersion curve is acquired by using laser scanning Doppler vibrometer. The damage indicator is calculated based on the energy of compensated signals registered by sensors. It is shown that apart from high energy level at excitation point, energy is concentrated exactly in the damaged region.

abstract = {The damage identification process provides relevant information about the current state of a structure under inspection, and it can be approached from two different points of view. The first approach uses data-driven algorithms, which are usually associated with the collection of data using sensors. Data are subsequently processed and analyzed. The second approach uses models to analyze information about the structure. In the latter case, the overall performance of the approach is associated with the accuracy of the model and the information that is used to define it. Although both approaches are widely used, data-driven algorithms are preferred in most cases because they afford the ability to analyze data acquired from sensors and to provide a real-time solution for decision making; however, these approaches involve high-performance processors due to the high computational cost. As a contribution to the researchers working with data-driven algorithms and applications, this work presents a brief review of data-driven algorithms for damage identification in structural health-monitoring applications. This review covers damage detection, localization, classification, extension, and prognosis, as well as the development of smart structures. The literature is systematically reviewed according to the natural steps of a structural health-monitoring system. This review also includes information on the types of sensors used as well as on the development of data-driven algorithms for damage identification.},

abstract = {This research is related to a signal processing of full wavefield data as an effective tool for detection, localization and visualization of a crack growth in thin-walled structures. Full wavefield data of propagating Lamb waves in structures such as plates and shells made out of metallic alloys and composite laminates contain a wealth of information about wave pattern anomalies due to occurrence of a damage. The aim is to demonstrate a method for enhancing damage visualization in structures such that estimation of the length and orientation of the crack can be easily obtained. The proposed signal processing involves application of discrete fast Fourier transform, wavenumber domain filtering and inverse discrete Fourier transform. The method is further enhanced by a technique for compensation of the wave attenuation so that the effects of structural damage have the same influence regardless of the location. The concept is first illustrated on numerically simulated data, and then tested on experimental results. In the experiments, full wavefield measurements are obtained using a scanning laser Doppler vibrometer, which allows the measurement of displacements and/or velocities along three axes over a user-defined grid. In the proposed method only out-of-plane velocities are used. Tests performed on simple aluminum and composite plates with artificially introduced longitudinal cracks confirm the effectiveness of the method and its potential for application to the inspection of a variety of structural components. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

In damage identification, damage features derived from available input-output and output-only time and frequency data are used to detect, locate, and quantify damage in structural dynamic systems. A new set of damage features and their implementation for damage detection and quantification are discussed in this article. These features are the autoregressive and exogenous coefficients in a frequency domain data model and can be used to distinguish between linear and nonlinear types of damage. In this work, autoregressive coefficients are used to characterize nonlinear damage and exogenous coefficients are used to characterize linear damage states. The ability to distinguish between linear and nonlinear types of damage and healthy system nonlinearities is critical when diagnosing structural health because damage initiation and growth are fundamentally nonlinear processes. It is shown that absolute damage severity can sometimes be determined solely from the degree of linearity-nonlinearity in the system. Experimental data from a three-story building model is analyzed using these features and some important application issues are discussed.},

The purpose of this book is to provide the mix designer with useful knowledge on granular materials and porous materials, which will enable the innovative design of concrete. Topics covered include the characterization of granular materials, the concepts of porosity and specific surface area, and the transport properties (diffusion and permeation) of concrete. Some of these topics are already covered in other general books dedicated to granular or porous materials. The objective here is to bring them together in one book by adapting them for use by concrete specialists.

Mentioned algorithm uses Lamb wave propagation methods for discontinuities localisation. Elastic waves were generated and received using piezoelectric transducers. They were arranged in concentrated arrays distributed on the specimen surface. In this way almost whole specimen could be monitored using this combined distributed-concentrated transducer network. Excited elastic waves propagate and reflect from panel boundaries and discontinuities existing in the panel. Wave reflection were registered through the piezoelectric transducers and used in signal processing algorithm. Proposed processing algorithm consists of two parts: signal filtering and extraction of obstacles location. The first part was used in order to enhance signals by removing noise from them. Second part allowed to extract features connected with wave reflections from discontinuities. Extracted features damage influence maps were a basis to create damage influence maps. Damage maps indicated intensity of elastic wave reflections which corresponds to obstacles coordinates. Described signal processing algorithms were implemented in the MATLAB environment. It should be underlined that in this work results based only on experimental signals were presented. {\textcopyright} 2010 SPIE.},

The technique uses diagnostic signals, generated from nearby piezoelectric actuators built into the structures, to detect crack growth. It consists of three major components: diagnostic signal generation, signal processing and damage interpretation. In diagnostic signal generation, appropriate ultrasonic guided Lamb waves were selected for actuators to maximize receiving sensor measurements. In signal processing, methods were developed to select an individual mode for damage detection and maximize signal to noise ratio in recorded sensor signals. Finally, in damage interpretation, a physics based damage index was developed relating sensor measurements to crack growth size. Fatigue tests were performed on laboratory coupons with a notch to verify the proposed technique. The damage index measured from built-in piezoceramics on the coupons showed a good correlation with the actual fatigue crack growth obtained from visual inspection. Furthermore, parametric studies were also performed to characterize the sensitivity of sensor/actuator location for the proposed technique.},

Single mode operation with the lowest order antisymmetric Lamb wave (Ao) mode is achieved in various plates at in agreement with theoretical predictions. The technique is applied for material characterization on single crystal silicon samples and defect detection in composite plates. The phase velocity anisotropy of the Ao mode is measured with signal-to-noise levels exceeding 65 dB. In (111) cut silicon plates the absolute phase velocity is measured with ±0.05{\%} accuracy. The phase velocity anisotropy and effects of delamination in layered composite plates are calculated using the surface impedance approach.

This investigation supports the development of the composite long-range variable-direction emitting radar (CLoVER) transducer. The analysis is based on the three-dimensional equations of elasticity, and the solution yields expressions for the field variables that are able to capture the multimodal nature of GWs. The assumption of uncoupled dynamics between the actuator and substrate is used, and their interaction is modeled through shear tractions along the transducer's radial edges. A similar problem is modeled using three-dimensional finite element simulations to assess the spatial and transient accuracy of the solution. Experimental tests are also conducted on pristine structures to validate the accuracy of the theoretical approach. The experimental studies employ CLoVER transducers developed in-house, and their manufacturing procedure is briefly described. Frequency response experiments based on piezoelectric sensors are conducted to assess the performance of the solution in the frequency domain. These tests are complemented by laser vibrometer measurements that allow the spatial and temporal evolution of the solution to be evaluated. The numerical simulations and experimental tests show that the wave time of arrival, radial attenuation, and azimuthal distribution are well captured by the theoretical solution. {\textcopyright} 2009 IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract = {Structural health monitoring (SHM) using guided waves is one of the only ways in which damage anywhere in a structure can be detected using a sparse array of permanently attached sensors. To distinguish damage from structural features, some form of comparison with damage-free reference data is essential, and here subtraction is considered. The detectability of damage is determined by the amplitude of residual signals from structural features remaining after the subtraction of reference data. These are non-zero due to changing environmental conditions such as temperature. In this paper, the amplitude of the residual signals is quantified for different guided-wave SHM strategies. Comparisons are made between two methods of reference signal subtraction and between two candidate sensor configurations. These studies allow estimates to be made of the number of sensors required per unit area to reliably detect a prescribed type of damage. It is shown that the number required is prohibitively high, even in the presence of modest temperature fluctuations, hence some form of temperature compensation is absolutely essential for guided-wave SHM systems to be viable. A potential solution is examined and shown to provide an improvement in signal suppression of approximately 30dB, which corresponds to two orders of magnitude reduction in the number of sensors required. {\textcopyright} 2007 The Royal Society.},

However, the successful application of these methods to real structures is still a challenging task, due primarily to the large size of such structures and the relatively high levels of variability in their dynamic response under operational load conditions. In this paper, a new methodology is introduced for the application of VBDD techniques, with the goal of enhancing their effectiveness for identifying and locating low damage levels and improving their applicability to the continuous or periodic health monitoring of structures. The basic features of the methodology include the use of a controlled and consistent excitation force, the use of operational deflection shapes (ODSs) at all measured frequency increments rather than only at natural frequencies, the use of a logarithmic scale for representing the ODS amplitudes at each frequency increment and the establishment of a threshold level for damage detection that accounts for experimental variability. The performance of the proposed methodology is verified and demonstrated by applying several Level 1 (damage detection) and Level 2 (damage localization) VBDD techniques using experimental data measured on a steel girder taken from a railway bridge. The proposed approach is shown to perform very well at detecting, locating and monitoring the growth of damage. Copyright {\textcopyright} 2011 John Wiley {\&} Sons, Ltd.},

In the course of the rapid advancement of diagnostic methods utilising elastic wave propagation, it has become clear that existing methods of elastic wave modeling and analysis are not always very useful; developing numerical methods aimed at modeling and analysing these phenomena has become a necessity. Furthermore, any methods developed need to be verified experimentally, which has become achievable with the advancement of measurement methods utilising laser vibrometry. Guided Waves in Structures for SHM reports on the simulation, analysis and experimental investigation related propagation of elastic waves in isotropic or laminated structures. The full spectrum of theoretical and practical issues associated with propagation of elastic waves is presented and discussed in this one study. Key features: Covers both numerical and experimental aspects of modeling, analysis and measurement of elastic wave propagation in structural elements formed from isotropic or composite materials. Comprehensively discusses the application of the Spectral Finite Element Method for modelling and analysing elastic wave propagation in diverse structural elements.

abstract = {An active diagnostic system using built-in piezoelectric actuator/sensor networks was developed for monitoring crack growth in a rocket engine pipe. The diagnostic system combines a sensor network, portable diagnostic hardware and data analysis software which allows for real-time in situ monitoring and long term tracking of the structural integrity of pressure vessels. Experimental data shows that the system can detect a surface crack as small as 4 mm and a through-crack as small as 2 mm in the high pressure engine pipe made of Inconel 718. It was found that the actuator-sensor paths that are most sensitive to crack growth are the ones in which the crack is growing away from, rather than towards the path. This discovery will provide important guidelines for the design of a sensor network for crack detection. It was also observed that the bending mode (equivalent to the A0 mode in plates) is more sensitive than the longitudinal mode (equivalent to the S0 mode in plates) to crack growth. {\textcopyright} SAGE Publications.},

abstract = {A hybrid piezoelectric/fiber optic diagnostic system has been developed for quick non-destructive evaluation and long term health monitoring of aerospace vehicles and structures. The hybrid diagnostic system uses piezoelectric actuators to input a controlled excitation to the structure and fiber optic sensors to capture the corresponding structural response. The system consists of three major parts: a diagnostic layer with a network of piezoelectric elements and fiber gratings to offer a simple and efficient way to integrate a large network of transducers onto a structure; diagnostic hardware consisting of an arbitrary waveform generator and a high speed fiber grating demodulation unit together with a high speed data acquisition card to provide actuation input, data collection, and information processing; and diagnostic software to determine the condition of the structure. This paper presents key development issues related to the manufacturing of the hybrid piezoelectric/fiber optic diagnostic layer and integration of a highly portable diagnostic hardware. Validation and proof testing of this integrated diagnostic system are also presented. {\textcopyright} 2005 IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract = {Fiber-optic sensors cannot measure damage; to get information about damage from strain measurements, additional strategies are needed, and several alternatives are available in the existing literature. This paper discusses two independent procedures. The first is based on detecting new strains appearing around a damage spot. The structure does not need to be under loads, the technique is very robust, and damage detectability is high, but it requires sensors to be located very close to the damage, so it is a local technique. The second approach offers wider coverage of the structure; it is based on identifying the changes caused by damage on the strain field in the whole structure for similar external loads. Damage location does not need to be known a priori, and detectability is dependent upon the sensor's network density, the damage size, and the external loads. Examples of application to real structures are given.},

abstract = {Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) in Aerospace Structures provides readers with the spectacular progress that has taken place over the last twenty years with respect to the area of Structural Health Monitoring (SHM). The widespread adoption of SHM could both significantly improve safety and reduce maintenance and repair expenses that are estimated to be about a quarter of an aircraft fleet's operating costs. The SHM field encompasses transdisciplinary areas, including smart materials, sensors and actuators, damage diagnosis and prognosis, signal and image processing algorithms, wireless intelligent sensing, data fusion, and energy harvesting. This book focuses on how SHM techniques are applied to aircraft structures with particular emphasis on composite materials, and is divided into four main parts. Part One provides an overview of SHM technologies for damage detection, diagnosis, and prognosis in aerospace structures. Part Two moves on to analyze smart materials for SHM in aerospace structures, such as piezoelectric materials, optical fibers, and flexoelectricity. In addition, this also includes two vibration-based energy harvesting techniques for powering wireless sensors based on piezoelectric electromechanical coupling and diamagnetic levitation. Part Three explores innovative SHM technologies for damage diagnosis in aerospace structures. Chapters within this section include sparse array imaging techniques and phase array techniques for damage detection. The final section of the volume details innovative SHM technologies for damage prognosis in aerospace structures. This book serves as a key reference for researchers working within this industry, academic, and government research agencies developing new systems for the SHM of aerospace structures and materials scientists. Provides key information on the potential of SHM in reducing maintenance and repair costs Analyzes current SHM technologies and sensing systems, highlighting the innovation in each area Encompasses chapters on smart materials such as electroactive polymers and optical fibers.},

abstract = {Structural health monitoring and damage detection techniques are tools of great importance in the off-shore, civil, mechanical and aeronautical engineering communities, both for safety reasons and because of the economic benefits that can result. The need to be able to detect damage in complex structures has led to the development of a vast range of techniques, of which many are based upon structural vibration analysis. In the present article, some of the latest advances in Structural Health Monitoring and Damage Detection are reviewed, with an emphasis on composite structures on the grounds that this class of materials currently has a wide range of engineering applications. FOREWORD-It should be noted that this review is not intended to be a general, all-encompassing review covering the whole range of structural health monitoring (SHM); it was planned as the starting point for a study focusing on damage detection, localization and assessment for certain kinds of structure. Thus, the line of thought behind the search and the structure of this review is a result of objectives beyond the scope of the paper itself. Nevertheless, it was considered that, once the above was understood, an updated synopsis such as this could also be useful for other researchers in the same field. {\textcopyright}2006 SAGE Publications.},

abstract = {Fibre composite structures have become the most attractive candidate for civil engineering applications. Fibre reinforced plastic polymer (FRP) composite materials have been used in the rehabilitation and replacement of the old degrading traditional structures or build new structures. However, the lack of design standards for civil infrastructure limits their structural applications. The majority of the existing applications have been designed based on the research and guidelines provided by the fibre composite manufacturers or based on the designer's experience. It has been a tendency that the final structure is generally over-designed. This paper provides a review on the available studies related to the design optimization of fibre composite structures used in civil engineering such as; plate, beam, box beam, sandwich panel, bridge girder, and bridge deck. Various optimization methods are presented and compared. In addition, the importance of using the appropriate optimization technique is discussed. An improved methodology, which considering experimental testing, numerical modelling, and design constrains, is proposed in the paper for design optimization of composite structures. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

A method of solving these problems has been proposed which uses the concept underlying the method of a small parameter and which reduces the problems to sequences of problems for bodies with rectilinear orthotropy. All relations in any approximation have been derived in accordance with the model of a linearly elastic body. 3. An example of a plate in compression has been shown where the specific effect of small-amplitude large-scale curving of the filler manifests itself. {\textcopyright} 1983 Plenum Publishing Corporation.},

Each chapter has been written by specialists in the subject area who possess a broad range of practical experience.
