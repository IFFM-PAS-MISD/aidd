	journal = {Smart Materials and Structures},
	abstract = {A hybrid piezoelectric/fiber optic diagnostic system has been developed for quick
non-destructive evaluation and long term health monitoring of aerospace vehicles and
structures. The hybrid diagnostic system uses piezoelectric actuators to input a controlled
excitation to the structure and fiber optic sensors to capture the corresponding
structural response. The system consists of three major parts: a diagnostic layer
with a network of piezoelectric elements and fiber gratings to offer a simple and
efficient way to integrate a large network of transducers onto a structure; diagnostic
hardware consisting of an arbitrary waveform generator and a high speed fiber
grating demodulation unit together with a high speed data acquisition card to
provide actuation input, data collection, and information processing; and diagnostic
software to determine the condition of the structure. This paper presents key
development issues related to the manufacturing of the hybrid piezoelectric/fiber
optic diagnostic layer and integration of a highly portable diagnostic hardware.
Validation and proof testing of this integrated diagnostic system are also presented.}
