abstract = {Structural health monitoring can be viewed as a problem in statistical pattern recognition involving operational evaluation, data cleansing, damage identification, and life prediction. In damage identification, damage features derived from available input-output and output-only time and frequency data are used to detect, locate, and quantify damage in structural dynamic systems. A new set of damage features and their implementation for damage detection and quantification are discussed in this article. These features are the autoregressive and exogenous coefficients in a frequency domain data model and can be used to distinguish between linear and nonlinear types of damage. In this work, autoregressive coefficients are used to characterize nonlinear damage and exogenous coefficients are used to characterize linear damage states. The ability to distinguish between linear and nonlinear types of damage and healthy system nonlinearities is critical when diagnosing structural health because damage initiation and growth are fundamentally nonlinear processes. It is shown that absolute damage severity can sometimes be determined solely from the degree of linearity-nonlinearity in the system. Experimental data from a three-story building model is analyzed using these features and some important application issues are discussed.},

First, a pitch-catch method using a pair of piezoelectric actuator and sensor is introduced to generate a damage indeX which can be used to characterize damage at a known location. Tests on airbus fuselage panels are conducted to verify the method and damage indeX. The damage indeX relates changes in the energy content of a specific Lamb wave mode selected by group velocity analysis to the eXtent of damage. Second, an imaging method based on multiple pitch-catch information, a network of piezoelectric actuator/sensors, is presented for characterizing damage (location and size) without need for a structural or damage model. The imaging method with an autofocusing feature is applied to aluminum plates and a stiffened composite panel for method verification. {\textcopyright} 2008 Sage Publications.},

abstract = {Structural health monitoring (SHM) using guided waves is one of the only ways in which damage anywhere in a structure can be detected using a sparse array of permanently attached sensors. To distinguish damage from structural features, some form of comparison with damage-free reference data is essential, and here subtraction is considered. The detectability of damage is determined by the amplitude of residual signals from structural features remaining after the subtraction of reference data. These are non-zero due to changing environmental conditions such as temperature. In this paper, the amplitude of the residual signals is quantified for different guided-wave SHM strategies. Comparisons are made between two methods of reference signal subtraction and between two candidate sensor configurations. These studies allow estimates to be made of the number of sensors required per unit area to reliably detect a prescribed type of damage. It is shown that the number required is prohibitively high, even in the presence of modest temperature fluctuations, hence some form of temperature compensation is absolutely essential for guided-wave SHM systems to be viable. A potential solution is examined and shown to provide an improvement in signal suppression of approximately 30dB, which corresponds to two orders of magnitude reduction in the number of sensors required. {\textcopyright} 2007 The Royal Society.},

abstract = {The signals acquired by measurements of elastic wave propagation have been used for damage detection since the 1970s. The measurements have been carried out mostly by using piezoelectric transducers of various types. Many different sensor configurations and data processing have been proposed to detect and localise structural defects, both for real-time and off-line testing. Nevertheless, in the last decade, significant progress in the measurement techniques such as scanning laser Doppler vibrometry and shearographic interferometry has been made. These techniques enable measurement of a full wavefield of elastic waves. This opens up new possibilities and solutions for the problems of the damage detection in structures. Many researchers successfully applied this type of measurements for the damage detection and localisation in thin-walled structures. Moreover, advanced signal processing techniques, such as wavenumber filtering, give the possibility of damage size estimation, by filling the gap between damage detection and damage prognosis. The aim of this paper is to give a comprehensive review of methods used for the full wavefield measurement. It also describes and compares selected signal processing algorithms developed for damage detection and visualisation based on these measuring techniques. Criticism aspects, as well as advantages of each algorithm, are denoted based on the authors' expertise in the field. {\textcopyright} 2014 Wiley Publishing Ltd.},

abstract = {The guided wave (GW) field excited by a wedge-shaped, anisotropic piezocomposite transducer, surface-bonded on an isotropic substrate is investigated with applications to large area structural health monitoring. This investigation supports the development of the composite long-range variable-direction emitting radar (CLoVER) transducer. The analysis is based on the three-dimensional equations of elasticity, and the solution yields expressions for the field variables that are able to capture the multimodal nature of GWs. The assumption of uncoupled dynamics between the actuator and substrate is used, and their interaction is modeled through shear tractions along the transducer's radial edges. A similar problem is modeled using three-dimensional finite element simulations to assess the spatial and transient accuracy of the solution. Experimental tests are also conducted on pristine structures to validate the accuracy of the theoretical approach. The experimental studies employ CLoVER transducers developed in-house, and their manufacturing procedure is briefly described. Frequency response experiments based on piezoelectric sensors are conducted to assess the performance of the solution in the frequency domain. These tests are complemented by laser vibrometer measurements that allow the spatial and temporal evolution of the solution to be evaluated. The numerical simulations and experimental tests show that the wave time of arrival, radial attenuation, and azimuthal distribution are well captured by the theoretical solution. {\textcopyright} 2009 IOP Publishing Ltd.},

Fibre reinforced plastic polymer (FRP) composite materials have been used in the rehabilitation and replacement of the old degrading traditional structures or build new structures. However, the lack of design standards for civil infrastructure limits their structural applications. The majority of the existing applications have been designed based on the research and guidelines provided by the fibre composite manufacturers or based on the designer's experience. It has been a tendency that the final structure is generally over-designed. This paper provides a review on the available studies related to the design optimization of fibre composite structures used in civil engineering such as; plate, beam, box beam, sandwich panel, bridge girder, and bridge deck. Various optimization methods are presented and compared. In addition, the importance of using the appropriate optimization technique is discussed.

Mentioned algorithm uses Lamb wave propagation methods for discontinuities localisation. Elastic waves were generated and received using piezoelectric transducers. They were arranged in concentrated arrays distributed on the specimen surface. In this way almost whole specimen could be monitored using this combined distributed-concentrated transducer network. Excited elastic waves propagate and reflect from panel boundaries and discontinuities existing in the panel. Wave reflection were registered through the piezoelectric transducers and used in signal processing algorithm. Proposed processing algorithm consists of two parts: signal filtering and extraction of obstacles location. The first part was used in order to enhance signals by removing noise from them. Second part allowed to extract features connected with wave reflections from discontinuities. Extracted features damage influence maps were a basis to create damage influence maps. Damage maps indicated intensity of elastic wave reflections which corresponds to obstacles coordinates. Described signal processing algorithms were implemented in the MATLAB environment.

abstract = {This research is related to a signal processing of full wavefield data as an effective tool for detection, localization and visualization of a crack growth in thin-walled structures. Full wavefield data of propagating Lamb waves in structures such as plates and shells made out of metallic alloys and composite laminates contain a wealth of information about wave pattern anomalies due to occurrence of a damage. The aim is to demonstrate a method for enhancing damage visualization in structures such that estimation of the length and orientation of the crack can be easily obtained. The proposed signal processing involves application of discrete fast Fourier transform, wavenumber domain filtering and inverse discrete Fourier transform. The method is further enhanced by a technique for compensation of the wave attenuation so that the effects of structural damage have the same influence regardless of the location. The concept is first illustrated on numerically simulated data, and then tested on experimental results. In the experiments, full wavefield measurements are obtained using a scanning laser Doppler vibrometer, which allows the measurement of displacements and/or velocities along three axes over a user-defined grid. In the proposed method only out-of-plane velocities are used. Tests performed on simple aluminum and composite plates with artificially introduced longitudinal cracks confirm the effectiveness of the method and its potential for application to the inspection of a variety of structural components. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Research in vibration-based damage identification has been rapidly expanding over the last few years. The basic idea behind this technology is that modal parameters (notably frequencies, mode shapes, and modal damping) are functions of the physical properties of the structure (mass, damping, and stiffness). Therefore, changes in the physical properties will cause detectable changes in the modal properties. The motivation for the development of this technology is presented. The methods are categorized according to various criteria such as the level of damage detection provided, model-based versus non-model-based methods, and linear versus nonlinear methods. The methods are also described in general terms including difficulties associated with their implementation and their fidelity. Past, current, and future-planned applications of this technology to actual engineering systems are summarized.

Linear wave scans were performed on narrow laminated specimens and sandwich beams with various cores by monitoring the transmitted waves with piezoceramic sensors. Optimal actuator and sensor configurations were devised through experimentation, and various types of driving signal were explored. These experiments provided a procedure capable of easily and accurately determining the time of flight of a Lamb wave pulse between an actuator and sensor. Lamb wave techniques provide more information about damage presence and severity than previously tested methods (frequency response techniques), and provide the possibility of determining damage location due to their local response nature.

abstract = {This introduction begins with a brief history of SHM technology development. Recent research has begun to recognise that a productive approach to the Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) problem is to regard it as one of statistical pattern recognition (SPR); a paradigm addressing the problem in such a way is described in detail herein as it forms the basis for the organisation of this book. In the process of providing the historical overview and summarising the SPR paradigm, the subsequent chapters in this book are cited in an effort to show how they fit into this overview of SHM. In the conclusions are stated a number of technical challenges that the authors believe must be addressed if SHM is to gain wider acceptance.},

abstract = {This work proposes a numerical approach based on a Semi-Analytical Finite Element (SAFE) model to predict temperature effects on guided waves generated and received by low-profile piezoceramic (PZT) transducers. The proposed model includes the cumulative role of transducer elements (actuator and sensor), substrate structure, and transducer/structure interaction, in the prediction of the full pitch-catch guided wave response under changing temperature. Experimental tests were carried out in a controlled environmental chamber at different temperatures ranging from -40 °C up to 60°C. Time and frequency domain based system responses were obtained. Numerical versus experimental results show that the proposed model is capable of capturing the effect of temperature on PZTs generated/received Lamb waves with great accuracy. In addition, because the SAFE is capable to model also wave propagation in anisotropic plates, the proposed model can lay the groundwork for the development of more robust Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) strategies for complex aerospace structures. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Condition-based maintenance refers to the installation of permanent sensors on a structure/system. By means of early fault detection, severe damage can be avoided, allowing efficient timing of maintenance works and avoiding unnecessary inspections at the same time. These are the goals for structural health monitoring (SHM). The changes caused by incipient damage on raw data collected by sensors are quite small, and are usually contaminated by noise and varying environmental factors, so the algorithms used to extract information from sensor data need to focus on sensitive damage features. The developments of SHM techniques over the last 20 years have been more related to algorithm improvements than to sensor progress, which essentially have been maintained without major conceptual changes (with regards to accelerometers, piezoelectric wafers, and fiber optic sensors). The main different SHM systems (vibration methods, strain-based fiber optics methods, guided waves, acoustic emission, and nanoparticle-doped resins) are reviewed, and the main issues to be solved are identified. Reliability is the key question, and can only be demonstrated through a probability of detection (POD) analysis. Attention has only been paid to this issue over the last ten years, but now it is a growing trend. Simulation of the SHM system is needed in order to reduce the number of experiments.},

abstract = {Piezoelectric transducer arrays are utilized in Structural Health Monitoring systems as a means for excitation and sensing of elastic waves. Anomalies of propagating waves have enabled to develop damage detection algorithms. Depending on actuation-sensing strategies these algorithms can be classified as pitch-catch and pulse-echo. Despite many signal processing methods such as delay-sum, time-reversal, probability-based diagnostic imaging, etc. the spatial damage information provided by the actuator-sensor paths to reconstruct the damage image is limited. A novel strategy based on Lamb wave focusing is proposed in order to increase damage imaging resolution. In the proposed method all actuators are used at the same time exciting specially designed waveforms so that inspect one specific point of the structure. Damage map is created by applying appropriate signal processing. It uses dispersion curve of selected Lamb wave mode for dispersion compensation. The dispersion curve is acquired by using laser scanning Doppler vibrometer. The damage indicator is calculated based on the energy of compensated signals registered by sensors. It is shown that apart from high energy level at excitation point, energy is concentrated exactly in the damaged region. An example of crack detection and visualization in an aluminum plate is shown confirming the accuracy of the proposed method. Also the proposed method is compared to well-established delay-and-sum algorithm.},

abstract = {Understanding and analysing the complex phenomena related to elastic wave propagation has been the subject of intense research for many years and has enabled application in numerous fields of technology, including structural health monitoring (SHM). In the course of the rapid advancement of diagnostic methods utilising elastic wave propagation, it has become clear that existing methods of elastic wave modeling and analysis are not always very useful; developing numerical methods aimed at modeling and analysing these phenomena has become a necessity. Furthermore, any methods developed need to be verified experimentally, which has become achievable with the advancement of measurement methods utilising laser vibrometry. Guided Waves in Structures for SHM reports on the simulation, analysis and experimental investigation related propagation of elastic waves in isotropic or laminated structures. The full spectrum of theoretical and practical issues associated with propagation of elastic waves is presented and discussed in this one study. Key features: Covers both numerical and experimental aspects of modeling, analysis and measurement of elastic wave propagation in structural elements formed from isotropic or composite materials. Comprehensively discusses the application of the Spectral Finite Element Method for modelling and analysing elastic wave propagation in diverse structural elements. Presents results of experimental measurements employing advanced laser technologies, validating the quality and correctness of the developed numerical models. Accompanying website (www.wiley.com/go/ostachowicz) contains demonstration versions of commercial software developed by the authors for modelling and analyzing elastic wave propagation using the Spectral Finite Element Method. Guided Waves in Structures for SHM provides a state of the art resource for researchers and graduate students in structural health monitoring, signal processing and structural dynamics.

The development of simple formulation rules therefore requires the assimilation of this knowledge and a good command of the properties of these materials. The purpose of this book is to provide the mix designer with useful knowledge on granular materials and porous materials, which will enable the innovative design of concrete. Topics covered include the characterization of granular materials, the concepts of porosity and specific surface area, and the transport properties (diffusion and permeation) of concrete. Some of these topics are already covered in other general books dedicated to granular or porous materials. The objective here is to bring them together in one book by adapting them for use by concrete specialists.

The diagnostic system combines a sensor network, portable diagnostic hardware and data analysis software which allows for real-time in situ monitoring and long term tracking of the structural integrity of pressure vessels. Experimental data shows that the system can detect a surface crack as small as 4 mm and a through-crack as small as 2 mm in the high pressure engine pipe made of Inconel 718. It was found that the actuator-sensor paths that are most sensitive to crack growth are the ones in which the crack is growing away from, rather than towards the path. This discovery will provide important guidelines for the design of a sensor network for crack detection. It was also observed that the bending mode (equivalent to the A0 mode in plates) is more sensitive than the longitudinal mode (equivalent to the S0 mode in plates) to crack growth. {\textcopyright} SAGE Publications.},

The sources can be represented by a variety of dynamic nuclei of strains based on the theory of elastic waves. The dispersion of signals radiated by these sources in a wave guide such as a thick plate or a thick walled cylinder is analyzed by applying the theory of generalized ray, and the theory of normal modes. The analysis supplies the information on the propagational speeds of dominant signals that are detectable by transducers at various observational points, from which it is possible to locate a source by triangulation. It also provides a rational basis to determine the kinetic and kinematic characterists of a source through deconvolution and other semi-inverse procedures.

abstract = {Vibration-based damage detection (VBDD) comprises a promising set of techniques for damage detection and health monitoring of civil engineering structures. However, the successful application of these methods to real structures is still a challenging task, due primarily to the large size of such structures and the relatively high levels of variability in their dynamic response under operational load conditions. In this paper, a new methodology is introduced for the application of VBDD techniques, with the goal of enhancing their effectiveness for identifying and locating low damage levels and improving their applicability to the continuous or periodic health monitoring of structures. The basic features of the methodology include the use of a controlled and consistent excitation force, the use of operational deflection shapes (ODSs) at all measured frequency increments rather than only at natural frequencies, the use of a logarithmic scale for representing the ODS amplitudes at each frequency increment and the establishment of a threshold level for damage detection that accounts for experimental variability. The performance of the proposed methodology is verified and demonstrated by applying several Level 1 (damage detection) and Level 2 (damage localization) VBDD techniques using experimental data measured on a steel girder taken from a railway bridge. The proposed approach is shown to perform very well at detecting, locating and monitoring the growth of damage. Copyright {\textcopyright} 2011 John Wiley {\&} Sons, Ltd.},

abstract = {The damage identification process provides relevant information about the current state of a structure under inspection, and it can be approached from two different points of view. The first approach uses data-driven algorithms, which are usually associated with the collection of data using sensors. Data are subsequently processed and analyzed. The second approach uses models to analyze information about the structure. In the latter case, the overall performance of the approach is associated with the accuracy of the model and the information that is used to define it. Although both approaches are widely used, data-driven algorithms are preferred in most cases because they afford the ability to analyze data acquired from sensors and to provide a real-time solution for decision making; however, these approaches involve high-performance processors due to the high computational cost. As a contribution to the researchers working with data-driven algorithms and applications, this work presents a brief review of data-driven algorithms for damage identification in structural health-monitoring applications. This review covers damage detection, localization, classification, extension, and prognosis, as well as the development of smart structures.

The LDV vibration output is an amplitude-modulated sine wave and mode shapes, defined along the scan line, may therefore be established by demodulation. Alternatively, in the frequency domain, the LDV output is a line spectrum, with sidebands centred on the excitation frequency and spaced at the scan frequency. The sideband amplitudes give series coefficients for the mode shape defined along the scan line - Fourier coefficients for a circular scan or, via a simple transform, polynomial coefficients for a sinusoidal straight line or area scan. Useful measurements can also be made, directed at a single point on a structure: a small-diameter circular scan will give the angular vibration of the structure at the centre of the circle; a conical scan, produced with a short-focus lens, will measure the translational vibration at the point of focus, in magnitude and direction.},

In diagnostic signal generation, appropriate ultrasonic guided Lamb waves were selected for actuators to maximize receiving sensor measurements. In signal processing, methods were developed to select an individual mode for damage detection and maximize signal to noise ratio in recorded sensor signals. Finally, in damage interpretation, a physics based damage index was developed relating sensor measurements to crack growth size. Fatigue tests were performed on laboratory coupons with a notch to verify the proposed technique. The damage index measured from built-in piezoceramics on the coupons showed a good correlation with the actual fatigue crack growth obtained from visual inspection. Furthermore, parametric studies were also performed to characterize the sensitivity of sensor/actuator location for the proposed technique.},

abstract = {In the area of modal test/analysis/correlation, significant effort has been expended over the past twenty years in order to make reduced models and to expand test data for correlation and eventual updating of the finite element models. This has been restricted by vibration measurements which are traditionally limited to the location of relatively few applied sensors. Advances in computers and digital imaging technology have allowed 3D digital image correlation (DIC) methods to measure the shape and deformation of a vibrating structure. This technique allows for full-field measurement of structural response, thus providing a wealth of simultaneous test data. This paper presents some preliminary results for the test/analysis/correlation of data measured using the DIC approach along with traditional accelerometers and a scanning laser vibrometer for comparison to a finite element model. The results indicate that all three approaches correlated well with the finite element model and provide validation for the DIC approach for full-field vibration measurement. Some of the advantages and limitations of the technique are presented and discussed. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Ltd.All rights reserved.},

The ACT generates ultrasonic pressure incident upon the surface of the plate. The pressure waves are partially refracted into the plate. The LDV is employed to measure the out-of-plane velocity of the excited Lamb wave mode at some distances where the Lamb waves are formed in the plate. The influence of the ACT angle of incidence on Lamb wave excitation is investigated and Snell's law is used to directly compute Lamb wave dispersion curves including phase and group velocity dispersion curves in aluminum plates from incident angles found to generate optimal A{\textless}inf{\textgreater}0{\textless}/inf{\textgreater} Lamb wave mode. The measured curves are compared to results obtained from a two-dimensional (2-D) Fast Fourier transform (FFT), Morlet wavelet transform (MWT) and theoretical predictions. It was concluded that the experimental results obtained using Snell's law concept are well in accordance with the theoretical solutions. The high degree of accuracy in the measured data with the theoretical results proved a high sensitivity of the air-coupled and laser ultrasound in characterizing Lamb wave dispersion in plate-like structures. The proposed non-contact hybrid system can effectively characterize the dispersive relation without knowledge of neither the materials characteristics nor the mathematical model.},

abstract = {A technique for the analysis of full wavefield data in the wavenumber/frequency domain is presented as an effective tool for damage detection, visualization and characterization. Full wavefield data contain a wealth of information regarding the space and time variation of propagating waves in damaged structural components. Such information can be used to evaluate the response spectrum in the frequency/wavenumber domain, which effectively separates incident waves from reflections caused by discontinuities encountered along the wave paths. This allows removing the injected wave from the overall response through simple filtering strategies, thus highlighting the presence of reflections associated to damage. The concept is first illustrated on analytical and numerically simulated data, and then tested on experimental results. In the experiments, full wavefield measurements are conveniently obtained using a Scanning Laser Doppler Vibrometer, which allows the detection of displacements and/or velocities over a user-defined grid, and it is able to provide the required spatial and time information in a timely manner. Tests performed on an aluminum plate with artificially seeded slits simulating longitudinal cracks show the effectiveness of the technique and its potential for application to the inspection of a variety of structural components.},

abstract = {Lamb waves are dispersive and multi-modal, which makes the interpretation of Lamb wave signals very difficult in either the time or frequency domain. In the this article, we present our studies on Lamb wave propagation characterization and crack detection using a hybrid lead zirconate titanate (PZT)-laser vibrometer system and frequency-wave number analysis. A scanning laser Doppler vibrometer is used to acquiring high-resolution time-space Lamb wavefield excited by a PZT actuator. The recorded wavefield is then transformed to frequency-wave number domain by two-dimensional Fourier transform. Wave spectrum in the frequency-wave number domain shows clear distinction among Lamb wave modes being present. These concepts are illustrated through several experimental tests. However, the space information is lost during this transformation. A short-space two-dimensional Fourier transform is then adopted to obtain the frequency-wave number spectra at various spatial locations, resulting in the space-frequency-wave number representation, which can show how the frequency-wave number component varies with respect to space dimension. It provides a means to study the wave propagation from the perspective of wave number domain. The space-frequency-wave number analysis has successfully been used for the study of wave interaction with structural discontinuity and crack detection on an aluminum plate. {\textcopyright} The Author(s) 2013.},

abstract = {In this work a problem of damage detection and localization was investigated. A new configuration of piezoelectric transducers was proposed. It consists of twelve transducers. It is in a form of an equilateral triangle that has a 2×2 transducer array in each vertex. Transducers of this configuration were used to excite and register guided waves in an aluminum alloy specimen. Due to known sensitivity of these waves to structural defects it was assumed that registered waves, in the form of voltage signals, carry information about the structure condition. A special algorithm was implemented to process these signals and extract features related to damage. This algorithm transfers information from the time domain to the spatial domain. Results are mapped into coordinate system assigned to monitored structure. In this way in the case of damage present outside or inside the configuration its coordinates are highlighted. In order to detect damage on the direct path between triangle vertices a damage index is defined that indicates whether there is damage present or not. Experimental investigation included three scenarios, one for outside and one for inside localization and one for direct path detection. Results showed that this method has a potential for Structural Health Monitoring of a structure made of an isotropic material. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

For this purpose a numerical simulation platform has been developed that allows extensive 3-D calculations of guided wave propagation including appropriate signal processing and data evaluation algorithms. Calculations in a quasi-isotropic plate are used to exemplary demonstrate various imaging approaches.

abstract = {The aim of this paper is to verify experimentally a damage localisation algorithm that is based on triangular sensor networks of two different densities. Such an approach enables one to obtain better damage localisation results than in the case of utilizing all possible of excitation-sensing combinations between transducers. In this paper an algorithm for damage localisation for a rectangular panel made of aluminium alloy has been presented. The algorithm was based on the principles of elastic wave propagation which takes advantage of the fact that any structural discontinuities result in changes in the propagation of elastic waves. These changes can be registered by piezoelectric transducers and next used by damage localisation algorithms. Elastic waves can be generated and registered using piezoelectric transducers which are very light and thin. Such transducers can be very simply attached to metallic or embedded into composite structural elements to be monitored. The proposed algorithm of damage localisation uses a network of transducers that are uniformly distributed over the area of an isotropic panel. The transducers are placed on the structure using triangulation process. After acquisition signals are processed and filtered in order to remove all high and low frequency noise. Application of the damage localisation algorithm in the case of the filtered signals results in damage influence maps.},

abstract = {The Lamb wave-based structural damage detection technique is widely viewed as one of the most encouraging tools for structural health monitoring. However, the propagation of Lamb waves is complicated. Damage-scattering components in the sensing signals may easily be mixed with the waves that come from the source and those reflected from boundaries. Traditionally, damage scattering signals are obtained by comparing test data with a baseline data. However, such a process is affected easily by environmental and operational variability. Major emphases of the research in this article are on developing a baseline-free damage diagnosis technique based on time reversal theory. First, the propagation of the Lamb wave and its time reversal process are discussed. Second, time window functions and improved piezoelectric actuators/sensors array arrangement are developed to separate the scattered signals from the sensing signals. A time reversal imaging method is also adopted to detect and show the damages. This method makes all the scattered signals focus at the corresponding sources so that damages can be revealed. The validity of the proposed method is demonstrated through experiment in which a quasi-isotropic composite plate with PZT array is successfully monitored without relying on any past baseline data.},

abstract = {Piezoelectric wafer active sensors (PWAS) are inexpensive, non-intrusive un-obtrusive devices that can be surface-mounted on existing structures, or inserted in a new composite structure. The PWAS can be used in both active and passive modes. In active mode, the PWAS generate Lamb waves that can exist as either traveling waves or standing waves. As traveling waves, PWAS-generated Lamb waves can be used with the pitch-catch, pulse-echo, or phased-array methods that arrow far-field and some medium-field damage detection. As standing waves, PWAS-generated Lamb waves can used in conjunction with the electro-mechanical (E/M) impedance technique that allows near field and some medium-field damage detection. This paper presents new results obtained in the use of PWAS for the structural health monitoring of aerospace vehicles. One set of results to be presented will refer to experiments performed on detection the crack propagation in a fracture-mechanics panel with a stress-concentration precrack in the center. The crack was propagated using cyclic fatigue loading in a large testing machine. The crack was imaged with the PWAS EUSR method, which is the guided Lamb wave equivalent of the P-wave C-scan, only that it is produced from a single location and does not need a raster x-y coverage like the conventional P-wave C-scan. PWAS EUSR measurements were taken while the testing machine was running, thus simulating in-service monitoring conditions. Another set of results refers to the PWAS monitoring of disbonds in an spacecraft panel. The E/M impedance technique is shown to distinguish clearly between a bonded and disbonded part. The E/M impedance of bonded part measured at different locations is shown to be consistently the same, with the actual curves overlapping, thus confirming that the impedance changes noticed at the disbonded location are solely due to disbonding.},

abstract = {A method for damage localization based on the phased array idea has been developed. Four arrays of transducers are used to perform a beam-forming procedure. Each array consists of nine transducers placed along a line, which are able to excite and register elastic waves. The A0 Lamb wave mode has been chosen for the localization method. The arrays are placed in such a way that the angular difference between them is 45° and the rotation point is the middle transducer, which is common for all the arrays. The idea has been tested on a square aluminium plate modeled by the Spectral Element Method. Two types of damage were considered, namely distributed damage, which was modeled as stiffness reduction, and cracks, modeled as separation of nodes between selected spectral elements. The plate is excited by a wave packet. The whole array system is placed in the middle of the plate. Each linear phased array in the system acts independently and produces maps of a scanned field based on the beam-forming procedure. These maps are made of time signals (transferred to space domain) that represent the difference between the damaged plate signals and those from the intact plate. An algorithm was developed to join all four maps. The final map is modified by proposed signal processing algorithm to indicate the damaged area of the plate more precisely. The problem for damage localization was investigated and exemplary maps confirming the effectiveness of the proposed system were obtained. It was also shown that the response of the introduced configuration removes the ambiguity of damage localization normally present when a linear phased array is utilized. The investigation is based exclusively on numerical data. {\textcopyright} SAGE Publications 2009.},

abstract = {Omni-directional guided wave array transducers contain a circular pattern of elements that individually behave as omni-directional point transmitters or receivers. The data set acquired from such an array contains time-domain signals from each permutation of transmitter and receiver. A phased addition algorithm is developed that allows an omni-directional, B-scan image of the surrounding plate to be synthesized from any geometry of array. Numerically simulated data from a single reflector is used to test the performance of the algorithm. The results from an array containing a fully populated circular area of elements (Type I array) are found to be good, but those from an array containing a single ring of elements (Type II array) contain many large side-lobes. An enhancement to the basic-phased addition algorithm is presented that uses deconvolution to suppress these side-lobes. The deconvolution algorithm enables a Type II array to equal the performance of a Type I array of the same overall diameter. The effect of diameter on angular resolution is investigated.
