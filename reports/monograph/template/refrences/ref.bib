abstract = {Structural health monitoring (SHM) using guided waves is one of the only ways in which damage anywhere in a structure can be detected using a sparse array of permanently attached sensors. To distinguish damage from structural features, some form of comparison with damage-free reference data is essential, and here subtraction is considered. The detectability of damage is determined by the amplitude of residual signals from structural features remaining after the subtraction of reference data. These are non-zero due to changing environmental conditions such as temperature. In this paper, the amplitude of the residual signals is quantified for different guided-wave SHM strategies. Comparisons are made between two methods of reference signal subtraction and between two candidate sensor configurations. These studies allow estimates to be made of the number of sensors required per unit area to reliably detect a prescribed type of damage. It is shown that the number required is prohibitively high, even in the presence of modest temperature fluctuations, hence some form of temperature compensation is absolutely essential for guided-wave SHM systems to be viable. A potential solution is examined and shown to provide an improvement in signal suppression of approximately 30dB, which corresponds to two orders of magnitude reduction in the number of sensors required. {\textcopyright} 2007 The Royal Society.},

@article{Doebling1998,
abstract = {This paper provides an overview of methods to detect, locate, and characterize damage in structural and mechanical systems by examining changes in measured vibration response. Research in vibration-based damage identification has been rapidly expanding over the last few years. The basic idea behind this technology is that modal parameters (notably frequencies, mode shapes, and modal damping) are functions of the physical properties of the structure (mass, damping, and stiffness). Therefore, changes in the physical properties will cause detectable changes in the modal properties. The motivation for the development of this technology is presented. The methods are categorized according to various criteria such as the level of damage detection provided, model-based versus non-model-based methods, and linear versus nonlinear methods. The methods are also described in general terms including difficulties associated with their implementation and their fidelity. Past, current, and future-planned applications of this technology to actual engineering systems are summarized. The paper concludes with a discussion of critical issues for future research in the area of vibration-based damage identification.},

abstract = {Vibration-based damage detection (VBDD) comprises a promising set of techniques for damage detection and health monitoring of civil engineering structures. However, the successful application of these methods to real structures is still a challenging task, due primarily to the large size of such structures and the relatively high levels of variability in their dynamic response under operational load conditions. In this paper, a new methodology is introduced for the application of VBDD techniques, with the goal of enhancing their effectiveness for identifying and locating low damage levels and improving their applicability to the continuous or periodic health monitoring of structures. The basic features of the methodology include the use of a controlled and consistent excitation force, the use of operational deflection shapes (ODSs) at all measured frequency increments rather than only at natural frequencies, the use of a logarithmic scale for representing the ODS amplitudes at each frequency increment and the establishment of a threshold level for damage detection that accounts for experimental variability. The performance of the proposed methodology is verified and demonstrated by applying several Level 1 (damage detection) and Level 2 (damage localization) VBDD techniques using experimental data measured on a steel girder taken from a railway bridge. The proposed approach is shown to perform very well at detecting, locating and monitoring the growth of damage. Copyright {\textcopyright} 2011 John Wiley {\&} Sons, Ltd.},

abstract = {Understanding and analysing the complex phenomena related to elastic wave propagation has been the subject of intense research for many years and has enabled application in numerous fields of technology, including structural health monitoring (SHM). In the course of the rapid advancement of diagnostic methods utilising elastic wave propagation, it has become clear that existing methods of elastic wave modeling and analysis are not always very useful; developing numerical methods aimed at modeling and analysing these phenomena has become a necessity. Furthermore, any methods developed need to be verified experimentally, which has become achievable with the advancement of measurement methods utilising laser vibrometry. Guided Waves in Structures for SHM reports on the simulation, analysis and experimental investigation related propagation of elastic waves in isotropic or laminated structures. The full spectrum of theoretical and practical issues associated with propagation of elastic waves is presented and discussed in this one study. Key features: Covers both numerical and experimental aspects of modeling, analysis and measurement of elastic wave propagation in structural elements formed from isotropic or composite materials. Comprehensively discusses the application of the Spectral Finite Element Method for modelling and analysing elastic wave propagation in diverse structural elements. Presents results of experimental measurements employing advanced laser technologies, validating the quality and correctness of the developed numerical models. Accompanying website (www.wiley.com/go/ostachowicz) contains demonstration versions of commercial software developed by the authors for modelling and analyzing elastic wave propagation using the Spectral Finite Element Method. Guided Waves in Structures for SHM provides a state of the art resource for researchers and graduate students in structural health monitoring, signal processing and structural dynamics. This book should also provide a useful reference for practising engineers within structural health monitoring and non-destructive testing. {\textcopyright} 2012 John Wiley {\&} Sons, Ltd.},

Families of curves are obtained for aluminum and zirconium. The distinguishing characteristics of the various modes are discussed in the light of potential nondestructive testing applications. It is shown that the interior particles are displaced in elliptical orbits, with vertical motions existing at the surfaces when the wave velocity is (2) 1/2 shear wave velocity, and horizontal surface motions existing for wave velocities equal to longitudinal wave velocity. {\textcopyright} 1961 The American Institute of Physics.},

The diagnostic system combines a sensor network, portable diagnostic hardware and data analysis software which allows for real-time in situ monitoring and long term tracking of the structural integrity of pressure vessels. Experimental data shows that the system can detect a surface crack as small as 4 mm and a through-crack as small as 2 mm in the high pressure engine pipe made of Inconel 718. It was found that the actuator-sensor paths that are most sensitive to crack growth are the ones in which the crack is growing away from, rather than towards the path. This discovery will provide important guidelines for the design of a sensor network for crack detection. It was also observed that the bending mode (equivalent to the A0 mode in plates) is more sensitive than the longitudinal mode (equivalent to the S0 mode in plates) to crack growth. },

The structure does not need to be under loads, the technique is very robust, and damage detectability is high, but it requires sensors to be located very close to the damage, so it is a local technique. The second approach offers wider coverage of the structure; it is based on identifying the changes caused by damage on the strain field in the whole structure for similar external loads. Damage location does not need to be known a priori, and detectability is dependent upon the sensor's network density, the damage size, and the external loads.

Fibre reinforced plastic polymer (FRP) composite materials have been used in the rehabilitation and replacement of the old degrading traditional structures or build new structures. However, the lack of design standards for civil infrastructure limits their structural applications. The majority of the existing applications have been designed based on the research and guidelines provided by the fibre composite manufacturers or based on the designer's experience. It has been a tendency that the final structure is generally over-designed. This paper provides a review on the available studies related to the design optimization of fibre composite structures used in civil engineering such as; plate, beam, box beam, sandwich panel, bridge girder, and bridge deck. Various optimization methods are presented and compared. In addition, the importance of using the appropriate optimization technique is discussed. An improved methodology, which considering experimental testing, numerical modelling, and design constrains, is proposed in the paper for design optimization of composite structures. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {In this paper the impact response of continuous fibre-reinforced composites is reviewed. An attempt is made to draw together much of the work published in the literature and to identify the fundamental parameters determining the impact resistance of continuous fibre-reinforced composite materials. The effect of varying the properties of the fibre, matrix and interphase are examined as well as the role of target geometry and loading rate on the dynamic response of these materials. {\textcopyright} 1991.},

@book{Balageas2010,
abstract = {This book is organized around the various sensing techniques used to achieve structural health monitoring. Its main focus is on sensors, signal and data reduction methods and inverse techniques, which enable the identification of the physical parameters, affected by the presence of the damage, on which a diagnostic is established. Structural Health Monitoring is not oriented by the type of applications or linked to special classes of problems, but rather presents broader families of techniques: vibration and modal analysis; optical fibre sensing; acousto-ultrasonics, using piezoelectric transducers; and electric and electromagnetic techniques. Each chapter has been written by specialists in the subject area who possess a broad range of practical experience. The book will be accessible to students and those new to the field, but the exhaustive overview of present research and development, as well as the numerous references provided, also make it required reading for experienced researchers and engineers. {\textcopyright} 2006 ISTE Ltd.},
