abstract = {Structural health monitoring and damage detection techniques are tools of great importance in the off-shore, civil, mechanical and aeronautical engineering communities, both for safety reasons and because of the economic benefits that can result. The need to be able to detect damage in complex structures has led to the development of a vast range of techniques, of which many are based upon structural vibration analysis. In the present article, some of the latest advances in Structural Health Monitoring and Damage Detection are reviewed, with an emphasis on composite structures on the grounds that this class of materials currently has a wide range of engineering applications. FOREWORD-It should be noted that this review is not intended to be a general, all-encompassing review covering the whole range of structural health monitoring (SHM); it was planned as the starting point for a study focusing on damage detection, localization and assessment for certain kinds of structure. Thus, the line of thought behind the search and the structure of this review is a result of objectives beyond the scope of the paper itself. Nevertheless, it was considered that, once the above was understood, an updated synopsis such as this could also be useful for other researchers in the same field. {\textcopyright}2006 SAGE Publications.},

abstract = {Fibre composite structures have become the most attractive candidate for civil engineering applications. Fibre reinforced plastic polymer (FRP) composite materials have been used in the rehabilitation and replacement of the old degrading traditional structures or build new structures. However, the lack of design standards for civil infrastructure limits their structural applications. The majority of the existing applications have been designed based on the research and guidelines provided by the fibre composite manufacturers or based on the designer's experience. It has been a tendency that the final structure is generally over-designed. This paper provides a review on the available studies related to the design optimization of fibre composite structures used in civil engineering such as; plate, beam, box beam, sandwich panel, bridge girder, and bridge deck. Various optimization methods are presented and compared. In addition, the importance of using the appropriate optimization technique is discussed. An improved methodology, which considering experimental testing, numerical modelling, and design constrains, is proposed in the paper for design optimization of composite structures. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Abstract Long-haul travel does not constitute an obstacle for tourists to travel and is fast gaining the attention of tourists in new and unique experiences. This study was conducted to identify the long-haul travel motivation by international tourists to Penang. A total of 400 respondents participated in this survey, conducted around the tourist attractions in Penang, using cluster random sampling. However, only 370 questionnaires were only used for this research. Data were analysed using SPSS software 22 version. The findings, ‘knowledge and novelty seeking' were the main push factors that drove long-haul travel by international tourists to Penang. Meanwhile, the main pull factor that attracts long- haul travel by international tourists to Penang was its ‘culture and history'. Additionally, there were partly direct and significant relationships between socio-demographic, trip characteristics and travel motivation (push factors and pull factors). Overall, this study identified the long-haul travel motivations by international tourists to Penang based on socio-demographic, trip characteristics and travel motivation and has indirectly helped in understanding the long-haul travel market particularly for Penang and Southeast Asia. This research also suggested for an effective marketing and promotion strategy in pro- viding useful information that is the key to attract international tourists to travel long distances.

abstract = {Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) in Aerospace Structures provides readers with the spectacular progress that has taken place over the last twenty years with respect to the area of Structural Health Monitoring (SHM). The widespread adoption of SHM could both significantly improve safety and reduce maintenance and repair expenses that are estimated to be about a quarter of an aircraft fleet's operating costs. The SHM field encompasses transdisciplinary areas, including smart materials, sensors and actuators, damage diagnosis and prognosis, signal and image processing algorithms, wireless intelligent sensing, data fusion, and energy harvesting. This book focuses on how SHM techniques are applied to aircraft structures with particular emphasis on composite materials, and is divided into four main parts. Part One provides an overview of SHM technologies for damage detection, diagnosis, and prognosis in aerospace structures. Part Two moves on to analyze smart materials for SHM in aerospace structures, such as piezoelectric materials, optical fibers, and flexoelectricity. In addition, this also includes two vibration-based energy harvesting techniques for powering wireless sensors based on piezoelectric electromechanical coupling and diamagnetic levitation. Part Three explores innovative SHM technologies for damage diagnosis in aerospace structures. Chapters within this section include sparse array imaging techniques and phase array techniques for damage detection. The final section of the volume details innovative SHM technologies for damage prognosis in aerospace structures. This book serves as a key reference for researchers working within this industry, academic, and government research agencies developing new systems for the SHM of aerospace structures and materials scientists. Provides key information on the potential of SHM in reducing maintenance and repair costs Analyzes current SHM technologies and sensing systems, highlighting the innovation in each area Encompasses chapters on smart materials such as electroactive polymers and optical fibers.},

Its main focus is on sensors, signal and data reduction methods and inverse techniques, which enable the identification of the physical parameters, affected by the presence of the damage, on which a diagnostic is established. Structural Health Monitoring is not oriented by the type of applications or linked to special classes of problems, but rather presents broader families of techniques: vibration and modal analysis; optical fibre sensing; acousto-ultrasonics, using piezoelectric transducers; and electric and electromagnetic techniques. Each chapter has been written by specialists in the subject area who possess a broad range of practical experience. The book will be accessible to students and those new to the field, but the exhaustive overview of present research and development, as well as the numerous references provided, also make it required reading for experienced researchers and engineers. {\textcopyright} 2006 ISTE Ltd.},

	abstract = {A hybrid piezoelectric/fiber optic diagnostic system has been developed for quick
non-destructive evaluation and long term health monitoring of aerospace vehicles and
structures. The hybrid diagnostic system uses piezoelectric actuators to input a controlled
excitation to the structure and fiber optic sensors to capture the corresponding
structural response. The system consists of three major parts: a diagnostic layer
with a network of piezoelectric elements and fiber gratings to offer a simple and
efficient way to integrate a large network of transducers onto a structure; diagnostic
hardware consisting of an arbitrary waveform generator and a high speed fiber
grating demodulation unit together with a high speed data acquisition card to
provide actuation input, data collection, and information processing; and diagnostic
software to determine the condition of the structure. This paper presents key
development issues related to the manufacturing of the hybrid piezoelectric/fiber
optic diagnostic layer and integration of a highly portable diagnostic hardware.
Validation and proof testing of this integrated diagnostic system are also presented.}

    abstract = { An active diagnostic system using built-in piezoelectric actuator/sensor networks was developed for monitoring crack growth in a rocket engine pipe. The diagnostic system combines a sensor network, portable diagnostic hardware and data analysis software which allows for real-time in situ monitoring and long term tracking of the structural integrity of pressure vessels. Experimental data shows that the system can detect a surface crack as small as 4 mm and a through-crack as small as 2 mm in the high pressure engine pipe made of Inconel 718. It was found that the actuator-sensor paths that are most sensitive to crack growth are the ones in which the crack is growing away from, rather than towards the path. This discovery will provide important guidelines for the design of a sensor network for crack detection. It was also observed that the bending mode (equivalent to the A0 mode in plates) is more sensitive than the longitudinal mode (equivalent to the S0 mode in plates) to crack growth. }

ABSTRACT = {Fiber-optic sensors cannot measure damage; to get information about damage from strain measurements, additional strategies are needed, and several alternatives are available in the existing literature. This paper discusses two independent procedures. The first is based on detecting new strains appearing around a damage spot. The structure does not need to be under loads, the technique is very robust, and damage detectability is high, but it requires sensors to be located very close to the damage, so it is a local technique. The second approach offers wider coverage of the structure; it is based on identifying the changes caused by damage on the strain field in the whole structure for similar external loads. Damage location does not need to be known a priori, and detectability is dependent upon the sensor’s network density, the damage size, and the external loads. Examples of application to real structures are given.},
