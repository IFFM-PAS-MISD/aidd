abstract = {Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) concerns the continuous monitoring of civil and industrial buildings to increase human safety and to reduce maintenance costs. The SHM system furnishes information about the alterations in a single part or in the whole structure caused by materials aging, action of the environment, or accidental events. Typically, SHM systems are devoted to monitoring: humidity, temperature, accelerations, tensile stress, compressive stress, and building materials degradation. The methods used are non-invasive and require the deployment of sensors in checkpoints well defined by the experts. The information from the sensors is merged with the mathematical models to determine the structure safety.},

abstract = {The damage identification process provides relevant information about the current state of a structure under inspection, and it can be approached from two different points of view. The first approach uses data-driven algorithms, which are usually associated with the collection of data using sensors. Data are subsequently processed and analyzed. The second approach uses models to analyze information about the structure. In the latter case, the overall performance of the approach is associated with the accuracy of the model and the information that is used to define it. Although both approaches are widely used, data-driven algorithms are preferred in most cases because they afford the ability to analyze data acquired from sensors and to provide a real-time solution for decision making; however, these approaches involve high-performance processors due to the high computational cost. As a contribution to the researchers working with data-driven algorithms and applications, this work presents a brief review of data-driven algorithms for damage identification in structural health-monitoring applications. This review covers damage detection, localization, classification, extension, and prognosis, as well as the development of smart structures. The literature is systematically reviewed according to the natural steps of a structural health-monitoring system. This review also includes information on the types of sensors used as well as on the development of data-driven algorithms for damage identification.},

@book{Farrar2012,
abstract = {Understanding the rheological properties of fresh concrete, the hydration phenomenon of cement responsible for structuration, the relationship between the characteristics of the porous solid obtained and its mechanical performances or resistance to the aggressive penetration requires a complex knowledge of the physicochemistry of reactive porous materials. The development of simple formulation rules therefore requires the assimilation of this knowledge and a good command of the properties of these materials. The purpose of this book is to provide the mix designer with useful knowledge on granular materials and porous materials, which will enable the innovative design of concrete. Topics covered include the characterization of granular materials, the concepts of porosity and specific surface area, and the transport properties (diffusion and permeation) of concrete. Some of these topics are already covered in other general books dedicated to granular or porous materials. The objective here is to bring them together in one book by adapting them for use by concrete specialists. Applications in the form of exercises are offered at the end of each chapter to enable readers to assimilate the theoretical knowledge and to apply such knowledge to concrete problems encountered in civil engineering. {\textcopyright}2013 John Wiley {\&} Sons, Ltd.},

@article{Chang2000,
abstract = {A structural damage detection method based on parameter identification using an iterative neural network (NN) technique is proposed in this study. The NN model is first trained off-line using an initial training data set that consists of assumed structural parameters as outputs and their corresponding dynamic characteristics as inputs. The structural parameters are assumed with different levels of reduction to simulate various degrees of structural damage. The concept of orthogonal array is adopted to generate the representative combinations of parameter changes, which can significantly reduce the number of training data while maintaining the data completeness. A modified back-propagation learning algorithm is proposed which can overcome possible saturation of the sigmoid function and speed up the training process. The trained NN model is used to predict the structural parameters by feeding in measured dynamic characteristics. The predicted structural parameters are then used in the FE model to calculate the dynamic characteristics. The NN model would go through a retraining process if the calculated characteristics deviate from the measured ones. The identified structural parameters are then used to infer the location and the extent of structural damages. The proposed method is verified both numerically and experimentally using a clamped-clamped T beam. The results indicate that the current approach can identify both the location and the extent of damages in the beam.},

abstract = {The process of implementing a damage identification strategy for aerospace, civil and mechanical engineering infrastructure is referred to as structural health monitoring (SHM). Here, damage is defined as changes to the material and/or geometric properties of these systems, including changes to the boundary conditions and system connectivity, which adversely affect the system's performance. A wide variety of highly effective local non-destructive evaluation tools are available for such monitoring. However, the majority of SHM research conducted over the last 30 years has attempted to identify damage in structures on a more global basis. The past 10 years have seen a rapid increase in the amount of research related to SHM as quantified by the significant escalation in papers published on this subject. The increased interest in SHM and its associated potential for significant life-safety and economic benefits has motivated the need for this theme issue. This introduction begins with a brief history of SHM technology development. Recent research has begun to recognize that the SHM problem is fundamentally one of the statistical pattern recognition (SPR) and a paradigm to address such a problem is described in detail herein as it forms the basis for organization of this theme issue. In the process of providing the historical overview and summarizing the SPR paradigm, the subsequent articles in this theme issue are cited in an effort to show how they fit into this overview of SHM. In conclusion, technical challenges that must be addressed if SHM is to gain wider application are discussed in a general manner. {\textcopyright} 2006 The Royal Society.},

abstract = {The paper deals with the development of a Finite Element (FE) model aimed to simulate the propagation mechanisms of guided waves in a complex composite structure, such as a blended Glass Fibre Reinforced Polymers (GFRP) winglet, for real-time damage detection and monitoring purposes. The reliability of the herein presented FE model has been assessed against an experimental tests campaign, involving the winglet under both reference/pristine configuration and impacted/damaged configuration, also changing the actuator location. Because of the good level of accuracy shown by the numerical-experimental comparisons, the FE model has been used also for numerically investigating new actuators and damage position configurations, not experimentally analysed. Damage Indexes (DI's) have been calculated to quantify the variations of the signals' amplitude caused by the induced damage. Moreover, the Probability Ellipse (PE) method, which estimates the probability of the presence of the damage in the monitored area starting from the knowledge of selected DI's for each sensors-path, has been used in both older and newer damage position. The accuracy of the PE method in detecting the damage location is herein discussed.},

@article{Worden2007,
abstract = {In broad terms, there are two approaches to damage identification. Model-driven methods establish a high-fidelity physical model of the structure, usually by finite element analysis, and then establish a comparison metric between the model and the measured data from the real structure. If the model is for a system or structure in normal (i.e. undamaged) condition, any departures indicate that the structure has deviated from normal condition and damage is inferred. Data-driven approaches also establish a model, but this is usually a statistical representation of the system, e.g. a probability density function of the normal condition. Departures from normality are then signalled by measured data appearing in regions of very low density. The algorithms that have been developed over the years for data-driven approaches are mainly drawn from the discipline of pattern recognition, or more broadly, machine learning. The object of this paper is to illustrate the utility of the data-driven approach to damage identification by means of a number of case studies. {\textcopyright} 2006 The Royal Society.},
