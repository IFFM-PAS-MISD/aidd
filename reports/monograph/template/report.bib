abstract = {A structural damage detection method based on parameter identification using an iterative neural network (NN) technique is proposed in this study. The NN model is first trained off-line using an initial training data set that consists of assumed structural parameters as outputs and their corresponding dynamic characteristics as inputs. The structural parameters are assumed with different levels of reduction to simulate various degrees of structural damage. The concept of orthogonal array is adopted to generate the representative combinations of parameter changes, which can significantly reduce the number of training data while maintaining the data completeness. A modified back-propagation learning algorithm is proposed which can overcome possible saturation of the sigmoid function and speed up the training process. The trained NN model is used to predict the structural parameters by feeding in measured dynamic characteristics. The predicted structural parameters are then used in the FE model to calculate the dynamic characteristics. The NN model would go through a retraining process if the calculated characteristics deviate from the measured ones. The identified structural parameters are then used to infer the location and the extent of structural damages. The proposed method is verified both numerically and experimentally using a clamped-clamped T beam. The results indicate that the current approach can identify both the location and the extent of damages in the beam.},

abstract = {Understanding the rheological properties of fresh concrete, the hydration phenomenon of cement responsible for structuration, the relationship between the characteristics of the porous solid obtained and its mechanical performances or resistance to the aggressive penetration requires a complex knowledge of the physicochemistry of reactive porous materials. The development of simple formulation rules therefore requires the assimilation of this knowledge and a good command of the properties of these materials. The purpose of this book is to provide the mix designer with useful knowledge on granular materials and porous materials, which will enable the innovative design of concrete. Topics covered include the characterization of granular materials, the concepts of porosity and specific surface area, and the transport properties (diffusion and permeation) of concrete. Some of these topics are already covered in other general books dedicated to granular or porous materials. The objective here is to bring them together in one book by adapting them for use by concrete specialists. Applications in the form of exercises are offered at the end of each chapter to enable readers to assimilate the theoretical knowledge and to apply such knowledge to concrete problems encountered in civil engineering. {\textcopyright} 2013 John Wiley {\&} Sons, Ltd.},

abstract = {The paper deals with the development of a Finite Element (FE) model aimed to simulate the propagation mechanisms of guided waves in a complex composite structure, such as a blended Glass Fibre Reinforced Polymers (GFRP) winglet, for real-time damage detection and monitoring purposes. The reliability of the herein presented FE model has been assessed against an experimental tests campaign, involving the winglet under both reference/pristine configuration and impacted/damaged configuration, also changing the actuator location. Because of the good level of accuracy shown by the numerical-experimental comparisons, the FE model has been used also for numerically investigating new actuators and damage position configurations, not experimentally analysed. Damage Indexes (DI's) have been calculated to quantify the variations of the signals' amplitude caused by the induced damage. Moreover, the Probability Ellipse (PE) method, which estimates the probability of the presence of the damage in the monitored area starting from the knowledge of selected DI's for each sensors-path, has been used in both older and newer damage position. The accuracy of the PE method in detecting the damage location is herein discussed.},
