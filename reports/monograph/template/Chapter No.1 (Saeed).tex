%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
Numerous civil engineering and aerospace structures are exceeding or approaching their design lives. Therefore, assessing the condition of these structures is essential in order to determine their serviceability, safety
and load-carry capacity. Recently, Damage detection methods have been widely studied for the purpose of locating and quantifying structural damages. A damage can be defined as any degradation in the structural parameters which changes the dynamic behavior of the structure\cite{Chang2000}. Damage adversely affect the current or future performance of the system. There are many ways and indicators for detecting damage in a structure such as variations in strain, natural frequencies, time signal, etc.\cite{DeLuca2020}.

%The scheme of experimental setup is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:bc}.  
%The values are collected in Tab.~\ref{tab:xyz}.


%The details are described in a book~\cite{udd2011fiber}. 

%Similar case was analysed\cite{Badrinarayanan2017a} by Hill et al.
