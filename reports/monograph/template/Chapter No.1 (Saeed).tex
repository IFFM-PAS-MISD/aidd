\section{Structural Health Monitoring (SHM)}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
Numerous civil engineering and aerospace structures are exceeding or approaching their design lives. Therefore, assessing the condition of these structures is essential in order to determine their serviceability, safety
and load-carry capacity\cite{Chang2000}. It is very crucial to monitor the health of structural elements in mechanical, civil and aerospace industries where the essence of small defects may result in a very catastrophic failure. A defect or damage can be defined as any degradation in the structural parameters which changes the dynamic behavior of the structure\cite{Chang2000}. These changes can be in a micro-scale level such as material matrix anomalies or in the macro-scale level such as cracks. Damage adversely affect the current or future performance of the system. Recently, Damage detection methods have been widely studied for the purpose of locating and quantifying structural damages\cite{Chang2000}. There are many ways and indicators for detecting damage in a structure such as variations in strain, natural frequencies, time signal, etc.\cite{DeLuca2020}. Damage detection is usually accomplished in the context of one or more closely related disciplines which include: structural health monitoring (SHM), nondestructive evaluation (NDE) also known as nondestructive testing (NDT), condition monitoring (CM), health and usage monitoring system (HUMS), damage prognosis (DP) and statistical process control (SPC)\cite{Farrar2012}. SHM is usually referred to the process of implementing a damage detection strategy for civil, aerospace or mechanical engineering infrastructure. This process involves the observation of a structure or mechanical system over time using periodically spaced dynamic response measurements, the extraction of damage-sensitive features from these measurements and the statistical analysis of these features to determine the current state of system health. For long-term SHM, the output of this process is periodically updated information regarding the ability of the structure to continue to perform its intended function in light of the inevitable ageing and degradation resulting from the operational environments. Under an extreme event, such as an earthquake or unanticipated blast loading, SHM could be used for rapid condition screening, to provide, in near real time, reliable information about the performance of the system during the event and about the subsequent integrity of the system\cite{Farrar2012}.
