abstract = {Concrete structures are often subjected to a wide array of load conditions, such as fatigue and impact, and the consequent damages. Recently, smart materials, in particular the piezoelectric materials, have received high attention from the point of view of structural health monitoring (SHM). In this connection, the electro-mechanical impedance (EMI) is one of the latest and most effective techniques. The technique harnesses the piezoelectric property of lead-zirconate-titanate (PZT) patches to sense any incipient damage. In the research covered in the paper, embedded PZT patches are employed to monitor the accumulating damage in plain cement concrete subjected to fatigue and impact type loadings. Concrete specimens (150 mm cubes and 100$\phi$ × 200 mm cylinders) of grade M-25 are cast with embedded concrete vibration sensors (CVS). The impact loading is simulated by a free falling iron-ball of mass 5 kg dropped from variable heights of 2 m, 2.5 m and 3 m above the top surface of the test cubes. For fatigue tests, a 4000 kN cyclic compression testing machine is used to apply the fatigue load in a sinusoidal form. The admittance signatures from the embedded PZT patches for impact and fatigue tests are acquired using an LCR meter. These signatures are used to determine the PZT-identified equivalent system properties (damping, stiffness and mass) of the specimens at varying damage states. For impact tests, strain history during the impact process is acquired in addition to the admittance signatures. The results for impact tests show an increase in the maximum strain induced in the patch with the number of impacts, while the equivalent damping computed from the admittance signature is found to decrease with increasing damage. For fatigue tests, the equivalent damping is again found to decrease with increasing damage, finally undergoing a phenomenal increase near the failure. Based on these measurements, separate relationships have been developed for impact and fatigue induced damages linking the PZT-identified damping with remaining life.},

abstract = {This research is related to a signal processing of full wavefield data as an effective tool for detection, localization and visualization of a crack growth in thin-walled structures. Full wavefield data of propagating Lamb waves in structures such as plates and shells made out of metallic alloys and composite laminates contain a wealth of information about wave pattern anomalies due to occurrence of a damage. The aim is to demonstrate a method for enhancing damage visualization in structures such that estimation of the length and orientation of the crack can be easily obtained. The proposed signal processing involves application of discrete fast Fourier transform, wavenumber domain filtering and inverse discrete Fourier transform. The method is further enhanced by a technique for compensation of the wave attenuation so that the effects of structural damage have the same influence regardless of the location. The concept is first illustrated on numerically simulated data, and then tested on experimental results. In the experiments, full wavefield measurements are obtained using a scanning laser Doppler vibrometer, which allows the measurement of displacements and/or velocities along three axes over a user-defined grid. In the proposed method only out-of-plane velocities are used. Tests performed on simple aluminum and composite plates with artificially introduced longitudinal cracks confirm the effectiveness of the method and its potential for application to the inspection of a variety of structural components. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Over the last decade, optical fiber-based forms of microscopy and endoscopy have extended the realm of applicability for many imaging modalities. Optical fiber-based imaging modalities permit the use of remote illumination sources and enable flexible forms supporting the creation of portable and hand-held imaging instrumentations to interrogate within hollow tissue cavities. A common challenge in the development of such devices is the design and integration of miniaturized optical and mechanical components. Until recently, microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) sensors and actuators have been playing a key role in shaping the miniaturization of these components. This is due to the precision mechanics of MEMS, microfabrication techniques, and optical functionality enabling a wide variety of movable and tunable mirrors, lenses, filters, and other optical structures. Many promising results from MEMS based optical fiber endoscopy have demonstrated great potentials for clinical translation. In this article, reviews of MEMS sensors and actuators for various fiber-optical endoscopy such as fluorescence, optical coherence tomography, confocal, photo-acoustic, and two-photon imaging modalities will be discussed. This advanced MEMS based optical fiber endoscopy can provide cellular and molecular features with deep tissue penetration enabling guided resections and early cancer assessment to better treatment outcomes.},

abstract = {Guided-wave (GW) approaches have shown potential in various initial laboratory demonstrations as a solution to structural health monitoring (SHM) for damage prognosis. This thesis starts with an introduction to and a detailed survey of this field. Some critical areas where further research was required and those that were chosen to be addressed herein are highlighted. Those were modeling, design guidelines, signal processing and effects of elevated temperature. Three-dimensional elasticity-based models for GW excitation and sensing by finite dimensional surface-bonded piezoelectric wafer transducers and anisotropic piezocomposites are developed for various configurations in isotropic structures. The validity of these models is extensively examined in numerical simulations and experiments. These models and other ideas are then exploited to furnish a set of design guidelines for the excitation signal and transducers in GW SHM systems. A novel signal processing algorithm based on chirplet matching pursuits and mode identification for pulse-echo GW SHM is proposed. The potential of the algorithm to automatically resolve and identify overlapping, multimodal reflections is discussed and explored with numerical simulations and experiments. Next, the effects of elevated temperature as expected in internal spacecraft structures on GW transduction and propagation are explored based on data from the literature incorporated into the developed models. Results from the model are compared with experiments. The feasibility of damage characterization at elevated temperatures is also investigated. An extension of the modeling effort for GW excitation by finite-dimensional piezoelectric wafer transducers to composite plates is also proposed and verified by numerical simulations. At the end, future directions for research to make this technology more easily deployable in field applications are suggested.},

abstract = {Piezoelectric wafer active sensors (PWAS) used in structural health monitoring (SHM) applications are able to detect structural damage using Lamb waves. PWAS are small, lightweight, unobtrusive and inexpensive. They achieve direct transduction between electric and elastic wave energies. PWAS are charge mode sensors and can be used as both transmitters and receivers. The focus of this paper is to find a suitable in situ piezoelectric active sensor for sending and receiving Lamb waves to be used in the SHM of structures with a curved surface. Current SHM technology uses brittle piezoceramic (PZT) wafer active sensors. Since piezoceramics are brittle, this approach could only be used on flat surfaces. The motivation of our research was to explore the use of flexible piezoelectric materials, e.g.piezoelastic polymers such as PVDF. However, PVDF stiffness is orders of magnitude lower than the PZT stiffness, and hence PVDF Lamb wave transmitters are much weaker than PZT transmitters. Thus, our research proceeded in two main directions: (a)to model and understand how piezoelectric material properties affect the behaviour of piezoelectric wafer active sensors; and (b)to perform experiments to test the capabilities of the flexible PVDF PWAS in comparison with those of stiffer but brittle PZT PWAS. We have shown that, with appropriate signal amplification, PVDF PWAS can perform the same Lamb wave transmission and reception functions currently performed by PZT PWAS. The experimental results of PZT-PWAS and PVDF-PWAS have been compared with a conventional strain gauge. The theoretical and experimental results in this study gave a basic demonstration of the piezoelectricity of PZT-PWAS and PVDF-PWAS. {\textcopyright} 2006 IOP Publishing Ltd.},

In other words, the relation between impact energy and damage detectability will be shown. A numerical model based on the time domain spectral element method is used for modeling of Lamb wave propagation and interaction with barely visible impact damage in a carbon-epoxy laminate. Numerical studies are followed by experimental research on the same material with an impact damage induced by various energy and also a Teflon insert simulating delamination. Wavenumber adaptive image filtering and signal processing are used for damage visualization and assessment for both numerical and experimental full wavefield data. It is shown that it is possible to visualize and assess the impact damage location, size and to some extent severity by using the proposed technique.},

abstract = {Joint structures, such as riveting, hinges, and flanges, are widely used in complex mechanical systems. A small unexpected change of a joint can lead to complicated wave-scattering in its connected waveguides. The conversion between wave modes can be used to quantify the variation of the connection status of joints. This gives rise to the challenge of exciting and sensing only one specific wave mode in practice. In this paper, transmitted wave amplitudes of a flange joint are first calculated by the wave finite element method (WFEM) to study the quantitative relationship between the local stiffness changes of the damaged site and the wave-mode conversion. Wave-mode piezoelectric transducers are subsequently designed for torsional, longitudinal, and flexural waves in cylindrical waveguides. The idea is to use the distribution and interconnection of the piezoelectric materials to cancel the charge contributed from the non-targeting waves. We conducted numerical simulations to demonstrate the selective coupling features of the designed wave transducers and found difference of several orders of magnitude in voltages between targeting wave mode and other wave modes. Four selected wave transducers were then extended to monitor the connection status of the flange. The wave-scattering features in the simulation and WFEM were verified to be in good agreement.},

abstract = {Delamination in composite structures plays a major role in lowering structural strength and stiffness, consequently downgrading system integrity and reliability. A Lamb wave-based quantitative identification technique for delamination in CF/EP composite structures was established. Propagation of Lamb waves in a series of composite laminates, individually bearing a delamination, was evaluated using dynamic FEM analyses. Taking advantage of wavelet transform and artificial neural algorithms, an Intelligent Signal Processing and Pattern Recognition (ISPPR) package was developed, by which the spectrographic characteristics of simulated Lamb wave signals in the time-frequency domain were extracted and digitised as Digital Damage Fingerprints (DDF), to construct a Damage Parameters Database (DPD). The DPD was then used offline to train a multi-layer feedforward artificial neural network (ANN) under supervision of an error-backpropagation (BP) algorithm. Assisted by an active online structural health monitoring (AO-SHM) system with an active piezoelectric actuator/sensor network, the proposed methodology was validated online by identifying actual delaminations in CF/EP (T650/F584) quasi-isotropic composite laminates. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {The field of power harvesting has experienced significant growth over the past few years due to the ever-increasing desire to produce portable and wireless electronics with extended lifespans. Current portable and wireless devices must be designed to include electrochemical batteries as the power source. The use of batteries can be troublesome due to their limited lifespan, thus necessitating their periodic replacement. In the case of wireless sensors that are to be placed in remote locations, the sensor must be easily accessible or of a disposable nature to allow the device to function over extended periods of time. Energy scavenging devices are designed to capture the ambient energy surrounding the electronics and convert it into usable electrical energy. The concept of power harvesting works towards developing self-powered devices that do not require replaceable power supplies. A number of sources of harvestable ambient energy exist, including waste heat, vibration, electromagnetic waves, wind, flowing water, and solar energy. While each of these sources of energy can be effectively used to power remote sensors, the structural and biological communities have placed an emphasis on scavenging vibrational energy with piezoelectric materials. This article will review recent literature in the field of power harvesting and present the current state of power harvesting in its drive to create completely self-powered devices. {\textcopyright} IOP Publishing Ltd.},

Although several sensing technologies have been developed for use in SHM systems, fiber optic sensors, especially Fiber Bragg grating sensors (FBGs), are now attracting much attention due to their advantages over other types of sensors. This paper presents a new FBG strain sensor with an unsymmetrical packaging configuration designed to be fixed to the surface of the monitored structure. A 3D Finite Element numerical analysis of the sensor, packaging and adhesive used to fix the system to the host structure was conducted to study the influence of (1) the thickness and mechanical properties of the adhesive, and (2) the configuration of the packaging on the accuracy of the sensor. The results obtained from the numerical models show that the strains measured by the proposed system and the actual strains in the host structure differ by less than 2.5{\%} due to the fact that the packaging contains only one layer of composite material in an unsymmetrical configuration. The proposed design can thus be said to be an improvement compared to the typical configurations of optical fiber surface strain sensors. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

The theoretical analysis is accomplished by means of a hybrid method called the global local finite element method, in which a bounded region enclosing the hole and the cracks is discretized into finite elements, while the field external to this region is represented analytically in terms of Lamb wave modes. The scattered field is calculated through the application of the boundary conditions at the interface between the discretized region and the unbounded exterior. In the experiments the incident Lamb wave of a specific mode is generated by means of a wedge transducer and the waves scattered by the hole is recorded in conventional contact type transducers located on the plate surface. The measured time histories and amplitude spectra of the transmitted and reflected waves are compared with those calculated from the hybrid model. The agreement between the theoretical and experimental results is found to be excellent in the cases considered.

abstract = {Lamb waves are useful for detecting changes in material properties, as their propagation characteristics are sensitive to changes in the medium through which they travel. Defects and damage in materials/structures can be detected by analyzing the difference between the phase and/or group velocity amplitude and mode changes of Lamb waves' propagation in damaged versus un-damaged specimens. The propagation characteristics of Lamb waves are described in the form of dispersion curves, relating phase and/or group velocities to the product of frequency and thickness, with these curves being generated by solving the Lamb wave equations. In this article, the effect on the Lamb wave propagation/dispersion due to changes in the material properties such as E11, E22, G12, and density were analyzed for three different composite laminate types - unidirectional, cross-ply, and quasi-isotropic, all constructed out of 16-plies of unidirectional carbon-fiber epoxy prepregs. The analysis was performed by obtaining the characteristic Lamb waves' phase velocity dispersion and slowness curves for each laminate type. This was done by reducing E11, E22, and G12 by 5{\%}, 10{\%}, 15{\%} and 30{\%}, and density by 1{\%}, 2{\%}, 5{\%} and 10{\%} with the intent of representing manufacturing and in-service defects. Since the Lamb waves' velocity in a composite laminate varies with the propagation direction, the laminates were analyzed at 0°, 20°, 45°, 70°, and 90° propagation angles, with all the aforementioned variations. A program developed in MATLAB was used to generate the dispersion curves for the fundamental anti-symmetric and symmetric Lamb wave. The information provided in this paper can be used to select the proper Lamb wave modes, excitation frequency, which in turn governs sensor selection, data acquisition hardware, and damage detection algorithm for structural health monitoring of composite structures.},

abstract = {Today, the Structural Health Monitorin (SHM) methodology is the main way to deal with the detection and identification of damages in a range of engineering sectors, mainly in the military and civil aerospace industry. The need to monitor damages and failures in increasingly complex structures has led to the development of various detection techniques. Identification of damages through intelligent signal processing and optimization algorithms are particularly emphasized. The methods discussed here are mainly elaborated by the evaluation of modal data due to the great potential of their application. Moreover, the optimization of damage identification is approached through methods of optimal positioning of sensors for the acquisition of the data that must be evaluated so that conclusions can be made. This article discusses the use of computational and intelligent techniques for structural monitoring in the form of a review with emphasis on composite materials. Despite the excellent mechanical performance already known about composite materials, they have a weak point. While damages, in a metallic material are easily visible (in some cases), composite materials often have the superficial appearance as if in perfect condition, when, inside, there are serious damages. This paper can be seen as a guideline or a starting point for developing and improving SHM systems. The contents of this paper aim to help engineers and researchers find a starting point in developing a better solution to their specific structural monitoring problems, either by inverse methods, pattern recognition, and intelligent signal processing.},

abstract = {The damage detection method for composite laminates introduced in this research uses piezoelectric (lead zirconate titanate, PZT) transducers to excite/sense the Lamb wave signals. The complicated wave signals scattered by damage are accurately processed using a continuous wavelet transformation (CWT) based on the Gabor wavelet. The transducers are arranged on a composite laminate in the form of a network of square detection cells and triangular subcells. The damage location is estimated using the concept of centroid in two-stage detection method. The first stage detection is carried out by exciting a transducer at the center of each detection cell to locate the damaged cell and subcell. The damage localization is improved by exciting an additional transducer at the corner of the damaged subcell during the second stage detection. The damage size is then quantitatively estimated using cubic spline curve (CSC) and elliptical parametric (EP) methods based on the damage edge points. The damage location is estimated in two detection stages for high-accuracy because the damage edge points are calculated with reference to the estimated location of the damage. The arrangement of transducers and signal processing technique remain the same at all the stages of damage detection. Results from previous detection stages contribute to the improvement of damage detection in the subsequent stages. The size of detection cell plays a crucial role in designing the detection stages, and the proposed method can accurately quantify both location and size of the damage in composite laminate.},

Next, PWAS active sensing of various damage types in aluminum and composite structures are explored. PWAS transducers can successfully detect the simulated crack and corrosion damage in aluminum plates through the wavefield analysis, and the simulated delamination damage in composite plates through the damage imaging method. Finally, the novel use of PWAS transducers as acoustic emission (AE) sensors for in situ AE detection during fatigue crack growth is presented. The time of arrival of AE signals at multiple PWAS transducers confirms that the AE signals are originating from the crack, and that the amplitude decay due to geometric spreading is observed.},

Experimental results are presented for the application of Lamb wave techniques to quasi-isotropic graphite/epoxy test specimens containing representative damage modes, including delamination, transverse ply cracks and through-holes. Linear wave scans were performed on narrow laminated specimens and sandwich beams with various cores by monitoring the transmitted waves with piezoceramic sensors. Optimal actuator and sensor configurations were devised through experimentation, and various types of driving signal were explored. These experiments provided a procedure capable of easily and accurately determining the time of flight of a Lamb wave pulse between an actuator and sensor. Lamb wave techniques provide more information about damage presence and severity than previously tested methods (frequency response techniques), and provide the possibility of determining damage location due to their local response nature. These methods may prove suitable for structural health monitoring applications since they travel long distances and can be applied with conformable piezoelectric actuators and sensors that require little power.},

This paper reports a detailed account of guided wave interaction with delamination in laminated composites modeled using time domain spectral finite element (TSFE) method. Wave scattering due to different delamination positions is studied. Wave field near the delamination in different layer-wise positions is investigated, which is useful to further characterize and correlate the far field wave packet carrying the parametric signature of delamination. Off-axis delamination in composite laminate creates an asymmetry in the elastodynamic stress transfer. It leads to wave mode conversions. Sensitivity of the delamination to the wavelengths is studied. The outcome of this study indicates potential possibilities to use frequency-wavelength information to discriminate various sizes of delamination. Energy of the scattered waves and dissipation/conversion of the wave energy due to the defects depend on the resonance characteristics of the sub-laminates. Wave scattering effect due to length-wise multiple delaminations and edge delamination is also analyzed. The resonance patterns in the signals are analyzed with reference to the defect quantification problem.},

However, composite materials are prone to production defects and other defects originated during exploitation, which may jeopardize the safety of such a structure. Thus, non-destructive evaluation methods that are material-independent and suitable for a wide range of defects identification are needed. In this paper, a technique for damage characterization in composite plates is proposed. In the presented non-destructive testing method, guided waves are excited by a piezoelectric transducer, attached to tested specimens, and measured by a scanning laser Doppler vibrometer in a dense grid of points. By means of signal processing, irregularities in wavefield images caused by any material defects are extracted and used for damage characterization. The effectiveness of the proposed technique is validated on four different composite panels: Carbon fiber-reinforced polymer, glass fiber-reinforced polymer, composite reinforced by randomly-oriented short glass fibers and aluminum-honeycomb core sandwich composite. Obtained results confirm its versatility and efficacy in damage characterization in various types of composite plates.},

Traditionally in Lamb wave-based damage detection systems, the piezoelectric (PZT) wafer transducers are attached on the surface of composite components. However, surface-bonded PZT wafers are fragile, and they may lose serviceability when external load happens. In this paper, numerical and theoretical investigations are firstly carried out to analyze the Lamb wave features generated by PZT wafers that are located in the mid-thickness of a thin-walled plate. Subsequently, the authors integrate the PZT wafer arrays in woven glass fiber reinforced epoxy (WGF/epoxy) laminates with stacking sequence of [90°/0°] 4 . It is found that the approximate single S0 Lamb wave mode is generated by the built-in PZT wafers. This makes the received signals very simple and easy to be interpreted. Utilizing the signals obtained by the built-in and surface-bonded PZT wafer transmitter-receiver arrays, damage localization algorithms that considered the slowness profiles are compiled to help locating the defects. The compared results demonstrate that the built-in PZT strategy has great potential for quantitative non-destructive evaluation of composite structures.},

In honeycomb sandwich structures, wave propagation and interaction with typical defects such as hidden debonding damage are complicated; hence, the detection of defects using guided waves remains a challenging problem. The work presented in this article investigates the interaction of low-frequency guided waves with core–skin debonding damage in aluminum core honeycomb sandwich structures using finite element simulations. Due to debonding damage, the waves propagating in the debonded skin panel change to fundamental antisymmetric Lamb waves with different wavenumber values. Exploiting this mechanism, experimental inspection using a non-contact laser Doppler vibrometer was performed to acquire wavefield data from pristine and debonded structures. The data were then processed and analyzed with two wavefield data–based imaging approaches, the filter reconstruction imaging and the spatial wavenumber imaging. Both approaches can clearly indicate the presence, location, and size of the debonding in the structures, thus proving to be effective methods for debonding detection and quantification for honeycomb sandwich structures.},

abstract = {A multi-stage damage detection method based on Lamb waves is proposed for plate-like structures, which is not only for locating the damage position accurately, but also for estimating the damage size precisely. Considering a layout of PZT wafers in a square grid arrangement, the multi-stage damage detection method is based on the same PZT layout to achieve the damage detection in multiple stages with improving accuracy. Firstly, an aluminum plate with a hole is identified numerically by finite element method based on the multi-stage method. After the group velocity of Lamb wave in an aluminum plate is obtained numerically by the time of flight (ToF) and cross-correlation method, the position and size of holed-damage can be assessed by the first stage detection. The second stage is carried through one more data obtained by the same layout of PZT wafers, and the size of hole can be estimated more precisely. The third stage only depends on the need of improving detection results of the second stage. An experimental verification is carried through the multi-stage detection method applied in an aluminum plate with a hole. Therefore, the proposed method based on PZT wafers can conduct a multi-stage damage detection in the same PZT layout, and it can reach to a more accurate assessment quantitatively without requiring more PZT wafers. The method is simple and straightforward, and very cost effective in damage detection of plate-like structures.},

In the process, a combined theoretical analysis, time-domain spectral element simulation and experimental analysis of elastic wave propagation in a carbon-fibre reinforced adhesively-bonded composite structure have been carried out. It is shown that theoretical analysis and spectral formulation are effectively able to capture the behaviour of Lamb modes in the healthy structure due to variations in ambient temperature. It is found that the primary anti-symmetric Lamb wave mode amplitude and velocity decrease with an increase in ambient temperature. Furthermore, the spectral formulation accurately captures the effects of debonding on the Lamb wave signals under variable temperature conditions that are consistent with the experimental results. Finally, temperature correction factors are proposed for the primary anti-symmetric mode velocity and amplitude difference calculations and the effectiveness of the factors is successfully verified for selected study cases.},

abstract = {The health monitoring of aerostructures assists performance enhancement of existing structures. Continuous monitoring and different techniques involved in the structural monitoring help to increase the efficiency of structures, postpone the failures, and provide the prototype for future aerospace structures with better durability. Structural performance of aerospace composites depends on strength, stiffness, yield capacity, bending capacity, resistance against corrosion, impact and lightning, and fatigue due to cyclic loading. In structural monitoring, the four different stages followed to monitor any damage in aerospace composite structure are operation evaluation, data accession, feature extraction, followed by statistical modeling. This chapter on structural health monitoring for aerostructures elaborates the methods to detect and prevent the failures in the structures, as observed through a series of literature available based on the type of damages and techniques to detect them like cracking, fiber pullout, delamination and shearography, eddy current method, transient thermographic method, etc, respectively. In this chapter structural health monitoring of composite aerostructures is reviewed in detail. Different techniques used to monitor the various failures occurring in the composite structures in aerospace industry are explained in detail. Structures made of composite material used in aerospace fail due to fiber-matrix damage. Hence, it is important to analyze such damage like fiber buckling, fiber splitting, fiber cracking, fiber fracture, and fiber bending, and cracks in the matrix etc. to prevent catastrophic results.},

abstract = {Monitoring and analysing the integrity of structures and machinery is important for economic, operational, and mission critical reasons. In recent years, there has been growing interest in performing structural health monitoring (SHM) by monitoring structural dynamic response via micro electro-mechanical system accelerometers. In addition, the possibility of embedding these devices within a wireless sensor network and allowing measured data to be wirelessly transmitted has contributed to the development of many new applications not possible just a few years ago. These sensors, for use in SHM applications, need to detect low-amplitude and low frequency vibrations, operations which are not always feasible with the conventional low-cost sensor boards. Since the late 1990s, several accelerometer board prototypes have been proposed for achieving accurate vibration monitoring. This paper presents a summary review of the systems developed in the ten years following 2006 with particular emphasis on the sensing characteristics, performances, and applications of the designed sensor boards for microvibration detection and analysis.},

Anomalies of propagating waves have enabled to develop damage detection algorithms. Depending on actuation-sensing strategies these algorithms can be classified as pitch-catch and pulse-echo. Despite many signal processing methods such as delay-sum, time-reversal, probability-based diagnostic imaging, etc. the spatial damage information provided by the actuator-sensor paths to reconstruct the damage image is limited. A novel strategy based on Lamb wave focusing is proposed in order to increase damage imaging resolution. In the proposed method all actuators are used at the same time exciting specially designed waveforms so that inspect one specific point of the structure. Damage map is created by applying appropriate signal processing. It uses dispersion curve of selected Lamb wave mode for dispersion compensation. The dispersion curve is acquired by using laser scanning Doppler vibrometer. The damage indicator is calculated based on the energy of compensated signals registered by sensors. It is shown that apart from high energy level at excitation point, energy is concentrated exactly in the damaged region. An example of crack detection and visualization in an aluminum plate is shown confirming the accuracy of the proposed method. Also the proposed method is compared to well-established delay-and-sum algorithm.},

In spite of the many commendable advantages, the 3D-core sandwich composite structures are prone to barely visible low-speed impact damages that may significantly jeopardize the safety and integrity of the structural assembly. The aim of this paper is to develop an advanced structural health monitoring framework to efficiently identify such damages in the sandwich structure using ultrasonic guided wave propagation. Theoretical analysis, numerical simulations and laboratory experiments of guided wave propagation in 3DCSCS have been carried out to demonstrate the effectiveness of the identification of barely visible impact damages. It is found that the presence of such damage regions significantly magnifies the fundamental antisymmetric mode of the propagating signals. The 3D numerical simulation gives physical insight and a good agreement has been observed with experimental results which affirms our understanding of the effect of damage on the propagating waves. The impact damage regions in the sandwich structure are experimentally identified using a modified signal difference algorithm based health monitoring framework. The proposed structural monitoring framework is found to be significantly efficient for the detection of impact damages in a sandwich structure.},

abstract = {The theory of waves in an infinitely long cylindrical rod was discussed by Pochhammer in 1876 in a well-known paper. The somewhat simpler problem of two-dimensional waves in a solid bounded by parallel planes was considered by Lord Rayleigh and by the present writer‡ in 1889. The main object in these various investigations was to verify, or to ascertain small corrections to, the ordinary theory of the vibrations of thin rods or plates, and the wave-length was accordingly assumed in the end to be great in comparison with the thickness. It occurred to me some time ago that a further examination of the two-dimensional problem was desirable for more than one reason. In the first place, the number of cases in which the various types of vibration of a solid, none of whose dimensions is regarded as small, have been studied is so restricted that any addition to it would have some degree of interest, if merely as a contribution to elastic theory. Again, modern seismology has suggested various questions relating to waves and vibrations in an elastic stratum imagined as resting on matter of a different elasticity and density. These questions naturally present great mathematical difficulties, and it seemed unpromising to attempt any further discussion of them unless the comparatively simple problem which forms the subject of this paper should be found to admit of a practical solution. In itself it has, of course, no bearing on the questions referred to.},

First, ultrasonic wavefield is obtained from a target structure by scanning a Nd:YAG pulse laser beam for ultrasonic wave generation and measuring the corresponding ultrasonic responses using a laser Doppler vibrometer. Then, hidden damages are identified and visualized through adoption of a standing wave filter, which can isolate damage-induced standing waves from the obtained wavefield. The proposed technique has following advantages over the existing techniques: (1) it does not require any sensor installation; (2) it is noninvasive, rapidly deployable and applicable to harsh environments; and (3) it can visualize damage with high spatial resolution without any baseline data, which enables automated and intuitive damage diagnosis. The feasibility of the proposed technique is demonstrated by visualizing a debonding in a carbon fiber reinforced plastic aircraft wing and a delamination in a glass fiber reinforced plastic wind turbine blade. Furthermore, the effects of temperature and static loading variations on the proposed technique are also examined. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {This paper proposes a new inspection technique using Lamb waves to detect impact-induced delamination in composite laminates. The technique, which consists of two line scans, is as follows. The first scan measures the arrival times of the transmitted S0 mode along the 0° direction to detect delamination and evaluate its size. The second scan measures the maximum amplitude of the earliest wave packet in a line, including the longest delamination, to locate its edge. We performed this technique on impacted CFRP cross-ply laminates. A remarkable decrease in the arrival times due to the delamination is detected, and the delamination length can be calculated based on a simple model for Lamb-wave propagation. Furthermore, the delamination edge is located as a sudden decrease in the amplitude. The technique enables detecting the delamination and evaluating its size and location using only the two scans. We demonstrated the validity and usefulness of this technique. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The testing of large structures using conventional ultrasonic bulk wave techniques is slow because the test region is limited to the area immediately surrounding the transducer. Therefore, scanning is required if the whole structure is to be tested. Ultrasonic guided waves potentially provide an attractive solution to this problem because they can be excited at one location on the structure and will propagate many meters, returning echoes indicating the presence of corrosion or other discontinuities. However, guided wave testing is complicated by the presence of many possible wave modes, most of which are dispersive. These guided wave characteristics offer a wealth of opportunities for the extraction of information about the structure, but it is crucial to manage this complexity if the test is to be useable in industrial practice. Guided waves can be used in three regimes, which have been researched extensively by many authors: Short range (≪ 1 m [39 in.], for example leaky lamb wave testing of composite materials and high frequency surface wave scanning), medium range (up to about 5 m [16.4 ft], for example shear horizontal and Iamb waves in the 250 kHz to 1 MHz frequency range for plate and tube testing) and long range (up to 100 m [328 ft], for example the testing of pipelines). This paper concentrates on long range testing using frequencies below 100 kHz. The progress from research work to a robust, commercial pipe testing system is described, together with the more recent development of a test for rail. Future directions for guided wave testing are then discussed.},

abstract = {Composite materials which are widely used in the aerospace industry, are usually subjected to frequent variation of temperature. Thermal cyclic loading may induce material degradation. Considering the long-term service of aircraft composites and the importance of safety in the aircraft industry, even a little damage that may be accumulative via thermal fatigue is often of great concern. Therefore, there is a demand to develop non-destructive approaches to evaluate thermal fatigue damage in an early stage. Due to the sensitivity of acoustic nonlinearity to micro-damage, the nonlinear ultrasonic technique has been explored as a promising tool for early detection of micro-damage. This paper investigates an experimental scheme for characterizing thermal fatigue damage in composite laminates using second harmonic Lamb waves. The present results show a monotonic increase of acoustic nonlinearity with respect to thermal fatigue cycles. The experimental observation of the correlation between the acoustic nonlinearity and thermal fatigue cycles in carbon/epoxy laminates verifies that nonlinear Lamb waves can be used to assess thermal fatigue damage rendering improved sensitivity over conventional linear feature based non-destructive evaluation techniques. Velocity and attenuation based ultrasonic studies are carried out for comparison with the nonlinear ultrasonic approach and it is found that nonlinear acoustic parameters are more promising indicators of thermal fatigue damage than linear ones. {\textcopyright} 2012 IOP Publishing Ltd.},

For that purpose, piezoelectric transducers have been used to excite and register Lamb waves in the panels.

Three different experiments have been conducted to investigate the wave propagation phenomena. In the first experiment, the attenuation and dispersion of Lamb waves in the aluminium panel has been studied. The second experiment has been oriented to localise an additional mass attached to the same panel. A dedicated signal-processing algorithm has been developed to aid the localisation procedure that allowed to extract relevant features of the discontinuity. The algorithm has been tested on signals from the panel with and without the additional mass. The results obtained have been compared to find the position of the discontinuity. The third experiment concerned a more realistic damage scenario when piezoelectric transducers have been arranged as a clock-like array to find a crack in a composite panel. {\textcopyright} 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

abstract = {A novel piezoelectric thin-film accelerometer has been designed and its performance has been analysed. The piezoelectric thin film (PZT for example) is delineated into an array of pads to reduce the sensor capacitance. By filling the cavity around the PZT pads either with a polymer or a gas with controlled pressure, damping can be controlled. The piezoelectric thin-film material (i.e., pads) is clamped between a seismic mass and a base plate (silicon substrate). During acceleration in the axial direction the seismic mass exerts a force on the piezoelectric layer, resulting in the generation of a charge due to the piezoelectric effect. The induced charge is independent of the dimensions of the piezoelectric layer and hence of its tolerances. The generated charge is directly sensed by a charge-sensitive preamplifier that is implemented by CMOS technology on a tiny silicon chip. In principle, the proposed thin-film accelerometer can be integrated with the electronic readout and can be extended into an array of accelerometers. The dynamic response is presented and the trade-offs between several design considerations are discussed. For a specific design, a sensor sensitivity of 320 mV g-1 and lower and upper cut-off frequencies of, respectively, 1 Hz and 0.2 MHz have been calculated. By using differential sensing, the proposed thin-film accelerometer can be further developed to include compensation for temperature and pyroelectric effects. In addition, self-test features based on the application of electrostatic forces are feasible but require more sophisticated signal processing.},

abstract = {Composite materials which are widely used in the aerospace industry, are usually subjected to frequent variation of temperature. Thermal cyclic loading may induce material degradation. Considering the long-term service of aircraft composites and the importance of safety in the aircraft industry, even a little damage that may be accumulative via thermal fatigue is often of great concern. Therefore, there is a demand to develop non-destructive approaches to evaluate thermal fatigue damage in an early stage. Due to the sensitivity of acoustic nonlinearity to micro-damage, the nonlinear ultrasonic technique has been explored as a promising tool for early detection of micro-damage. This paper investigates an experimental scheme for characterizing thermal fatigue damage in composite laminates using second harmonic Lamb waves. The present results show a monotonic increase of acoustic nonlinearity with respect to thermal fatigue cycles. The experimental observation of the correlation between the acoustic nonlinearity and thermal fatigue cycles in carbon/epoxy laminates verifies that nonlinear Lamb waves can be used to assess thermal fatigue damage rendering improved sensitivity over conventional linear feature based non-destructive evaluation techniques. Velocity and attenuation based ultrasonic studies are carried out for comparison with the nonlinear ultrasonic approach and it is found that nonlinear acoustic parameters are more promising indicators of thermal fatigue damage than linear ones. {\textcopyright} 2012 IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract = {Delaminations in composite laminates resulting from impact events may be accompanied by minimal indication of damage at the surface. As such, inspections are required to ensure defects are within allowable limits. Conventional ultrasonic scanning techniques have been shown to effectively characterize the size and depth of delaminations but require physical contact with the structure and considerable setup time. Alternatively, a non-contact scanning laser vibrometer may be used to measure guided wave propagation in the laminate structure generated by permanently bonded transducers. A local Fourier domain analysis method is presented for processing guided wavefield data to estimate spatially dependent wavenumber values, which can be used to determine delamination depth. The technique is applied to simulated wavefields and results are analyzed to determine limitations of the technique with regards to determining defect size and depth. Based on simulation results, guidelines for application of the technique are developed. Finally, experimental wavefield data is obtained in quasi-isotropic carbon fiber reinforced polymer (CFRP) laminates with impact damage. The recorded wavefields are analyzed and wavenumber is measured to an accuracy of up to 8.5{\%} in the region of shallow delaminations. These results show the promise of local wavenumber domain analysis to characterize the depth of delamination damage in composite laminates. The technique can find application in automated vehicle health assurance systems with potential for high detection rates and greatly reduced operator effort and setup time. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.

A quasistatic loading was gradually applied on a specimen of carbon fiber reinforced epoxy resulting in dents on the surface. Lamb-wave measurements, from a sensor network mounted on the panel's surface, were taken for the intact condition and three damage cases (0.2, 0.5, and 2.7-mm dents). Three approaches were adopted to define the damage indices (DIs) toward anomaly detection, namely, amplitude variation, symbolic dynamics, and root mean square deviation. Data fusion was performed between measurements from multiple excitation frequencies for single and multiple DIs, where the anomaly combination between all the frequencies and the DIs was called a total anomaly. An imaging algorithm was implemented for damage localization in conjunction with single and combined DIs. It was shown that combining the effects of different frequencies and/or different DIs increases the robustness and consistency of the damage detection and localization process. Moreover, a distance-based classification technique was applied using features from single DIs and the combined anomaly measure. Accuracies higher than 91{\%} were attained for the majority of the cases tested.},

abstract = {A multistage damage detection method is introduced in this work that uses piezoelectric lead zirconate titanate (PZT) transducers to excite/sense the Lamb wave signals. A continuous wavelet transformation (CWT), based on the Gabor wavelet, is applied to accurately process the complicated wave signals caused by the damage. For a network of transducers, the damage can be detected in one detection cell based on the signals scattered by the damage, and then it can be quantitatively estimated by three detection stages using the outer tangent circle and least-squares methods. First, a single-stage damage detection method is carried out by exciting a transducer at the center of the detection cell to locate the damaged subcell. Then, the corner transducers are excited in the second and third stages of detection to improve the damage detection, especially the size estimation. The method does not require any baseline signal, and it only utilizes the same arrangement of transducers and the same data processing technique in all stages. The results from previous detection stages contribute to the improvement of damage detection in the subsequent stages. Both numerical simulation and experimental evaluation were used to verify that the method can accurately quantify the damage location and size. It was also found that the size of the detection cell plays a vital role in the accuracy of the results in this Lamb-wave-based multistage damage detection method.},

Previous works have investigated and shown that the acoustical nonlinearity parameter is a good tool to detect micro-structural damages like plasticity in metal and fatigue damages in metal and composites. In this work, the second harmonic generation is used to analyze composite specimens for impact damages. Therefore, Lamb waves are launched and detected by a piezoelectric actuator and sensor, respectively, at a certain frequency to generate cumulative second harmonic modes. The excitation frequency has to meet special conditions. The signal processing is done by using the wavelet transform to avoid misinterpretations that may occur using the short-time Fourier transform. The Morlet wavelet is used as the mother wavelet. The results of the relative acoustical nonlinearity parameter are compared to the development of the group velocity due to impact damages. It is shown that the relative acoustical nonlinearity parameter is more sensitive to impact damages than the development of the group velocity. {\textcopyright} 2015},

abstract = {This paper reports on the design and realization of a new optical fibre sensor for continuous measurement of concrete strain over very long distances. We propose a composite-made wave-like sensor body that enables continuous bonding between optical fibre and concrete. Finite element analysis shows that the stiffness of the optical fibre can be adapted to that of the concrete, reducing the strain concentrations and the need for a theoretical calibration factor. Moreover, unlike the body of traditional I-shaped sensors, a wave-like sensor body enables a symmetrical response in tensile and compressive loadings whatever the contact conditions may be. We have realized optical fibre extensometers based on this technique and on a low-coherence interferometry method for the measurements. Despite its wave-shape, the proposed sensor body does not introduce any losses or strain that would result from fibre microbending. The process of realization is adapted to distributed sensors and sensors with a very long gauge length. Furthermore, several sensors were multiplexed, demonstrating the ability to perform quasi-distributed measurements. Once embedded into concrete cylinders, the optical fibre sensors were tested under compressive and tensile loading, and compared with traditional sensors. The allocation of one of the multiplexed sensors as a dummy gauge provides self-compensation for thermal effects and ambient fluctuations. As a result, and without any calibration factor, optical sensor measurements perfectly agreed with external linear variable differential transducer measurements. {\textcopyright} 2006 IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract = {A fully non-contact laser-based nondestructive inspection (NDI) system is developed to detect and visualize damage in structures. The study focuses on the size quantification and characterization of a barely visible impact damage (BVID) in a honeycomb composite panel. The hardware consists of a Q-switched Nd:YAG pulse laser that probes the panel by generating broadband guided waves via thermo-elastic expansion. The laser, in combination with a set of galvano-mirrors is used to raster scan over a two-dimensional surface covering the damaged region of an impacted quasi-isotropic [60/0/−60]s honeycomb composite panel. The out-of-plane velocities are measured at a fixed location normal to the surface by a laser Doppler vibrometer (LDV). An ultrasonic full wavefield assembled from the three-dimensional space-time data matrix in the interrogated area is first acquired and then processed for imaging the impacted damage area. A wavenumber filtering technique in terms of wave vectors is applied to distinguish the forward and backward wavefields in the wavenumber-frequency domain. A zero-lag cross correlation (ZLCC) imaging condition is then employed in the space-frequency domain for damage imaging. The ZLCC imaging condition consists of cross correlating the incident and reflected wavefields in the entire scanned region. The condition not only images the damage boundary between incident and reflected waves outside the damage region but also, for longer time windows, enables to capture the momentary standing waves formed within the damaged region. The ZLCC imaging condition imaged two delaminated region: a main delamination, which was a skewed elliptic with major and minor axis lengths roughly 17 mm and 10 mm respectively, and a secondary delamination region approximately 6 mm by 4 mm, however, which can only be shown at higher frequency range around 80–95 kHz. To conclude, the ZLCC results were in very good agreement with ultrasonic C-scan and X-ray computed tomographic (X-ray CT) scan results. Since the imaging condition is performed in the space-frequency domain, the imaging from ZLCC can also reveal resonance modes which are shown in the main delaminated area by windowing a narrow frequency band sequentially.},

Here, damage is defined as changes to the material and/or geometric properties of these systems, including changes to the boundary conditions and system connectivity, which adversely affect the system's performance. A wide variety of highly effective local non-destructive evaluation tools are available for such monitoring. However, the majority of SHM research conducted over the last 30 years has attempted to identify damage in structures on a more global basis. The past 10 years have seen a rapid increase in the amount of research related to SHM as quantified by the significant escalation in papers published on this subject. The increased interest in SHM and its associated potential for significant life-safety and economic benefits has motivated the need for this theme issue. This introduction begins with a brief history of SHM technology development. Recent research has begun to recognize that the SHM problem is fundamentally one of the statistical pattern recognition (SPR) and a paradigm to address such a problem is described in detail herein as it forms the basis for organization of this theme issue. In the process of providing the historical overview and summarizing the SPR paradigm, the subsequent articles in this theme issue are cited in an effort to show how they fit into this overview of SHM. In conclusion, technical challenges that must be addressed if SHM is to gain wider application are discussed in a general manner. {\textcopyright} 2006 The Royal Society.},

abstract = {Impact damage is one of the major concerns in maintenance of aircraft structures built from composite materials. Damage detection in composite materials can be divided into active and passive approaches. The active approach is usually based on various non-destructive techniques utilizing actuators and/or receivers. In contrast passive approaches do not involve any actuators; receivers are used to "sense and/or hear" any perturbations caused by possible hidden damage. Often strain data are used to localize impacts and estimate their energy. The assumption is that damage occurs above well-defined energy of impacts. The paper illustrates one active and one passive method recently developed for impact damage detection. The first method, based on guided ultrasonic waves, utilises 3-D laser vibrometry and does not require any signal processing. Simple laser scans, revealing the change in Lamb wave response amplitudes, have been used to locate delamination and estimate its severity in a composite plate. In contrast, the second method does not require any sophisticated instrumentation but relies on advanced signal processing. An array of piezoceramic sensors has been to detect strain waves transmitted from an impact applied to the composite aircraft structure. The modified multilateration procedure with Genetic Algorithms has been used to locate impact position. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Today, the Structural Health Monitorin (SHM) methodology is the main way to deal with the detection and identification of damages in a range of engineering sectors, mainly in the military and civil aerospace industry. The need to monitor damages and failures in increasingly complex structures has led to the development of various detection techniques. Identification of damages through intelligent signal processing and optimization algorithms are particularly emphasized. The methods discussed here are mainly elaborated by the evaluation of modal data due to the great potential of their application. Moreover, the optimization of damage identification is approached through methods of optimal positioning of sensors for the acquisition of the data that must be evaluated so that conclusions can be made. This article discusses the use of computational and intelligent techniques for structural monitoring in the form of a review with emphasis on composite materials. Despite the excellent mechanical performance already known about composite materials, they have a weak point. While damages, in a metallic material are easily visible (in some cases), composite materials often have the superficial appearance as if in perfect condition, when, inside, there are serious damages. This paper can be seen as a guideline or a starting point for developing and improving SHM systems. The contents of this paper aim to help engineers and researchers find a starting point in developing a better solution to their specific structural monitoring problems, either by inverse methods, pattern recognition, and intelligent signal processing.},

abstract = {The signals acquired by measurements of elastic wave propagation have been used for damage detection since the 1970s. The measurements have been carried out mostly by using piezoelectric transducers of various types. Many different sensor configurations and data processing have been proposed to detect and localise structural defects, both for real-time and off-line testing. Nevertheless, in the last decade, significant progress in the measurement techniques such as scanning laser Doppler vibrometry and shearographic interferometry has been made. These techniques enable measurement of a full wavefield of elastic waves. This opens up new possibilities and solutions for the problems of the damage detection in structures. Many researchers successfully applied this type of measurements for the damage detection and localisation in thin-walled structures. Moreover, advanced signal processing techniques, such as wavenumber filtering, give the possibility of damage size estimation, by filling the gap between damage detection and damage prognosis. The aim of this paper is to give a comprehensive review of methods used for the full wavefield measurement. It also describes and compares selected signal processing algorithms developed for damage detection and visualisation based on these measuring techniques. Criticism aspects, as well as advantages of each algorithm, are denoted based on the authors' expertise in the field. {\textcopyright} 2014 Wiley Publishing Ltd.},

abstract = {The damage identification process provides relevant information about the current state of a structure under inspection, and it can be approached from two different points of view. The first approach uses data-driven algorithms, which are usually associated with the collection of data using sensors. Data are subsequently processed and analyzed. The second approach uses models to analyze information about the structure. In the latter case, the overall performance of the approach is associated with the accuracy of the model and the information that is used to define it. Although both approaches are widely used, data-driven algorithms are preferred in most cases because they afford the ability to analyze data acquired from sensors and to provide a real-time solution for decision making; however, these approaches involve high-performance processors due to the high computational cost. As a contribution to the researchers working with data-driven algorithms and applications, this work presents a brief review of data-driven algorithms for damage identification in structural health-monitoring applications. This review covers damage detection, localization, classification, extension, and prognosis, as well as the development of smart structures. The literature is systematically reviewed according to the natural steps of a structural health-monitoring system. This review also includes information on the types of sensors used as well as on the development of data-driven algorithms for damage identification.},

abstract = {Laminated composites are susceptible to delamination due to their weak transverse tensile and interlaminar shear strengths as compared to their in-plane properties. Delamination damage can occur internally, where it is not visible to the naked eye. Development of reliable, quantitative techniques for detecting delamination damage in laminated composite components will be imperative for safe and functional optimally designed next-generation composite structures. In this article, we study the potential of using Lamb waves for delamination detection and quantification, using model-assisted data acquisition. Novel wavenumber analysis approaches are developed and discussed to show how they can be used to investigate Lamb wave interactions with delaminated plies. Ultrasonic wave simulations are implemented to provide both in-plane and out-of-plane wave motion for the wavenumber studies. The out-of-plane results are verified against data obtained from experimental tests. It is found that the wavenumber methods can not only determine the delaminated region of the plate and its length, but can also identify the plies between which the delamination occurs. We envision that the wavenumber approaches can lead to a complete delamination quantification in the future.},

abstract = {Guided waves (GW) are of great interest for non-destructive testing (NDT) and structural health monitoring (SHM) of engineering structures such as for oil and gas pipelines, rails, aircraft components, adhesive bonds and possibly much more. Development of a technique based on GWs requires careful understanding obtained through modelling and analysis of wave propagation and mode-damage interaction due to the dispersion and multimodal character of GWs. The Scaled Boundary Finite Element Method (SBFEM) is a suitable numerical approach for this purpose allowing calculation of dispersion curves, mode shapes and GW propagation analysis. In this article, the SBFEM is used to analyse wave propagation in a plate consisting of an isotropic aluminium layer bonded as a hybrid to an anisotropic carbon fibre reinforced plastics layer. This hybrid composite corresponds to one of those considered in a Type III composite pressure vessel used for storing gases, e.g., hydrogen in automotive and aerospace applications. The results show that most of the wave energy can be concentrated in a certain layer depending on the mode used, and by that damage present in this layer can be detected. The results obtained help to understand the wave propagation in multi-layered structures and are important for further development of NDT and SHM for engineering structures consisting of multiple layers.},

By means of early fault detection, severe damage can be avoided, allowing efficient timing of maintenance works and avoiding unnecessary inspections at the same time. These are the goals for structural health monitoring (SHM). The changes caused by incipient damage on raw data collected by sensors are quite small, and are usually contaminated by noise and varying environmental factors, so the algorithms used to extract information from sensor data need to focus on sensitive damage features. The developments of SHM techniques over the last 20 years have been more related to algorithm improvements than to sensor progress, which essentially have been maintained without major conceptual changes (with regards to accelerometers, piezoelectric wafers, and fiber optic sensors). The main different SHM systems (vibration methods, strain-based fiber optics methods, guided waves, acoustic emission, and nanoparticle-doped resins) are reviewed, and the main issues to be solved are identified. Reliability is the key question, and can only be demonstrated through a probability of detection (POD) analysis. Attention has only been paid to this issue over the last ten years, but now it is a growing trend. Simulation of the SHM system is needed in order to reduce the number of experiments.},

Without a SHM capability the composite community has relied on detailed inspections during periodic maintenance actions to detect both structural damage and gage the extent of material degradation. Types of damage and degraded material properties include impact damage with the associated subsurface delaminations, debonding of fibers from the matrix at stress concentrations, corrosion of the fasteners used to join composites to metals, and failing adhesive bonds.

This paper investigates the relationship between StrId methods and DmId. We investigate which StrId method is suited for DmId for the type of damages that may affect civil infrastructure. It will be shown that some damages can be identified by StrId methods, while some other damages need specific methods that are not within the conventional realm of StrId methods.

This paper presents part of an experimental and analytical survey of candidate methods for in situ damage detection of composite materials. Experimental results are presented for the application of Lamb wave techniques to quasi-isotropic graphite/epoxy test specimens containing representative damage modes, including delamination, transverse ply cracks and through-holes. Linear wave scans were performed on narrow laminated specimens and sandwich beams with various cores by monitoring the transmitted waves with piezoceramic sensors. Optimal actuator and sensor configurations were devised through experimentation, and various types of driving signal were explored. These experiments provided a procedure capable of easily and accurately determining the time of flight of a Lamb wave pulse between an actuator and sensor. Lamb wave techniques provide more information about damage presence and severity than previously tested methods (frequency response techniques), and provide the possibility of determining damage location due to their local response nature. These methods may prove suitable for structural health monitoring applications since they travel long distances and can be applied with conformable piezoelectric actuators and sensors that require little power.},

Among the various existing techniques, guided wave methods provide a good promise in terms of sensitivity to a variety of damage types or defects and the extent of the area that can be monitored, given the ability of these waves to travel relatively long distances within the structure under investigation. In comparison with isotropic metallic structures, wave propagation in composite structures presents additional complexity for effective damage identification. The material inhomogeneity, anisotropy, and the multilayered construction of composite materials lead to significant dependence of wave modes on laminate layup configurations, direction of propagation, frequency, and interface conditions. In this article, a specific structure will be analyzed with different levels of complexities in an effort to determine the propagation characteristics of the waves. The investigated structure is a stiffened composite plate of finite thickness and infinite lateral dimensions. The work is carried out using theoretical analysis, numerical modeling, and laboratory experiments. Numerical (finite element) simulations are used for more realistic models, where the geometric and material complexities present practical difficulties in direct analysis using theoretical constructs only.},

abstract = {The solution of problems on the fracture of solids under the action of impulsive dynamic loadings encounters great difficulties. Even before the onset of fracture the process becomes very complicated because different parts of the body are governed by different "stress-strain" relation, and the position of the boundaries between these parts changes with time. When cracks appear, which lead to new time-dependent boundary conditions, one cannot even speak of any kind of rigorous solution of the problem. This paper is concerned with the study of dynamic stresses in a medium obeying Hooke's law. In materials whose elastic limit and ultimate strength are close to one another (under dynamic loading) such studies can identify points from which the formation of cracks in the first stage of fracture will originate. If, however, there exists a noticeable interval between the elastic limit and the ultimate strength, where the material is subjected to some inelastic deformations, then these studies can identify instants of time and parts of the body where dangerous stresses can be expected with the greatest probability. The rigorous solution also becomes useful in the evaluation of some approximate theories found in the literature. It shows, for instance, that the acoustic theory [1,2] is inadequate and the quasi-static theory [3] is limited in its applicability. Dynamic problems of the theory of elasticity in the case of a half-space, a single-layer or a multi-layered medium with plane-parallel separation boundaries were studied in many papers. A major protion of these papers is devoted to the development and also the the qualitative and quantitative study of formulas for the displacement-vector components. The transition to stresses somewhat complicates the solutions. This complication, however, is unimportant in analogous studies. {\textcopyright} 1960.},

abstract = {In broad terms, there are two approaches to damage identification. Model-driven methods establish a high-fidelity physical model of the structure, usually by finite element analysis, and then establish a comparison metric between the model and the measured data from the real structure. If the model is for a system or structure in normal (i.e. undamaged) condition, any departures indicate that the structure has deviated from normal condition and damage is inferred. Data-driven approaches also establish a model, but this is usually a statistical representation of the system, e.g. a probability density function of the normal condition. Departures from normality are then signalled by measured data appearing in regions of very low density. The algorithms that have been developed over the years for data-driven approaches are mainly drawn from the discipline of pattern recognition, or more broadly, machine learning. The object of this paper is to illustrate the utility of the data-driven approach to damage identification by means of a number of case studies. {\textcopyright} 2006 The Royal Society.},
