abstract = {Lamb wave based structural health monitoring shows a lot of potential for damage detection of composite structures. However, currently there is no agreement upon optimal network arrangement or detection algorithm. The objective of this research is to develop a sparse network that can be expanded to detect damage over a large area. To achieve this, a novel technique based on damage progression history has been developed. This technique gives an amplification factor to data along actuator-sensor paths that show a steady reduction in transmitted power as induced damage progresses and is implemented with the reconstruction algorithm for probabilistic inspection of damage (RAPID) technique. Two damage metrics are used with the algorithm and a comparison is made to the more commonly used signal difference coefficient (SDC) metric. Best case results show that damage is detected within 12 mm. The algorithm is also run on a more sparse network with no damage detection, therefore indicating that the selected arrangement is the most sparse arrangement with this configuration.

@article{okafor1996delamination,
abstract = {The effect of prescribed delamination on natural frequencies of laminated composite beam specimens is examined both experimentally and theoretically. Delamination is of particular interest because it can cause catastrophic failure of the composite structure. One consequence of delamination in a composite structure is a change in its stiffness. This change in stiffness will degrade the modal frequencies of the composite structure. Modal testing of a perfect beam and beams with different delamination size is conducted using polyvinylidene fluoride film (PVDF) sensors and piezoceramic (PZT) patch with sine sweep actuation. Modal testing of beams is also conducted using PVDF sensors and instrumented hammer excitation. The results of piezoceramic patch excitation and instrumented hammer excitation are discussed. The experimental modal frequencies are compared with the results obtained using a simplified beam theory. Also, backpropagation neural network models are developed using the results from the beam theory and used to predict delamination size. The effect of learning rate and momentum rate on neural network performance are discussed. Modal frequencies can be easily and accurately obtained with PZT patch excitation and PVDF sensing. There is good agreement between modal frequencies from modal testing and those from the simplified beam theory. The neural network models developed successfully predict delamination size.},

abstract = {Identification of elastic properties is relevant for both non-destructive material characterizations as well as for in-situ condition monitoring to predict any possible material degradation. In this paper, we have proposed deep learning frameworks to solve the inverse problem of material property identification using ultrasonic guided waves. The propagation of guided waves in a composite laminate is modelled using a reduced order Spectral Finite Element Method (SFEM). We have used two fundamental modes of a guided wave i.e. the anti-symmetric (A0) and the symmetric modes (S0) as inputs for the proposed deep learning models and elastic properties of a unidirectional composite laminate as outputs. The deep regression-based networks like, 1D-Convnets and LSTMs are used to map input space to target space. The performance of the algorithms is evaluated based on the mean squared loss value, coefficient of determination, and mean absolute error. It is seen that the networks can learn the inverse mapping and generalize well to unseen examples even in the presence of noise at various levels. This novel methodology can eliminate disadvantages associated with existing global optimization techniques in terms of accuracy, robustness, scale, and computational time.},

abstract = {A fully non-contact laser-based nondestructive inspection (NDI) system is developed to detect and visualize damage in structures. The study focuses on the size quantification and characterization of a barely visible impact damage (BVID) in a honeycomb composite panel. The hardware consists of a Q-switched Nd:YAG pulse laser that probes the panel by generating broadband guided waves via thermo-elastic expansion. The laser, in combination with a set of galvano-mirrors is used to raster scan over a two-dimensional surface covering the damaged region of an impacted quasi-isotropic [60/0/âˆ’60]s honeycomb composite panel. The out-of-plane velocities are measured at a fixed location normal to the surface by a laser Doppler vibrometer (LDV). An ultrasonic full wavefield assembled from the three-dimensional space-time data matrix in the interrogated area is first acquired and then processed for imaging the impacted damage area. A wavenumber filtering technique in terms of wave vectors is applied to distinguish the forward and backward wavefields in the wavenumber-frequency domain. A zero-lag cross correlation (ZLCC) imaging condition is then employed in the space-frequency domain for damage imaging. The ZLCC imaging condition consists of cross correlating the incident and reflected wavefields in the entire scanned region. The condition not only images the damage boundary between incident and reflected waves outside the damage region but also, for longer time windows, enables to capture the momentary standing waves formed within the damaged region. The ZLCC imaging condition imaged two delaminated region: a main delamination, which was a skewed elliptic with major and minor axis lengths roughly 17 mm and 10 mm respectively, and a secondary delamination region approximately 6 mm by 4 mm, however, which can only be shown at higher frequency range around 80â€“95 kHz. To conclude, the ZLCC results were in very good agreement with ultrasonic C-scan and X-ray computed tomographic (X-ray CT) scan results. Since the imaging condition is performed in the space-frequency domain, the imaging from ZLCC can also reveal resonance modes which are shown in the main delaminated area by windowing a narrow frequency band sequentially.},

abstract = {This paper presents a feasibility study on using Lamb waves to detect and locate through-width delamination in fiber-reinforced plastic beams. An active diagnostic system is proposed for clamped-free specimens. It consists of a piezoelectric patch and an accelerometer both mounted near the support. Such a system can locate damage in an absolute sense, that is, a priori knowledge on the response from pristine specimens is not required. The fundamental anti-symmetric Lamb wave mode is chosen as the diagnostic wave. It is generated by applying a voltage in the form of sinusoidal bursts to the piezoelectric patch. The proposed system was applied to locate delaminations in some fabricated Kevlar/epoxy beam specimens. With an appropriate actuating frequency, distortions of waveforms due to boundary reflections can be reduced. Based on their arrival times and the known propagating speed of Lamb waves, the delaminations can be located. The errors associated with the predicted damage positions range from 4.5% to 8.5%.},

abstract = {Abstract Long-haul travel does not constitute an obstacle for tourists to travel and is fast gaining the attention of tourists in new and unique experiences. This study was conducted to identify the long-haul travel motivation by international tourists to Penang. A total of 400 respondents participated in this survey, conducted around the tourist attractions in Penang, using cluster random sampling. However, only 370 questionnaires were only used for this research. Data were analysed using SPSS software 22 version. The findings, â€˜knowledge and novelty seeking' were the main push factors that drove long-haul travel by international tourists to Penang. Meanwhile, the main pull factor that attracts long- haul travel by international tourists to Penang was its â€˜culture and history'. Additionally, there were partly direct and significant relationships between socio-demographic, trip characteristics and travel motivation (push factors and pull factors). Overall, this study identified the long-haul travel motivations by international tourists to Penang based on socio-demographic, trip characteristics and travel motivation and has indirectly helped in understanding the long-haul travel market particularly for Penang and Southeast Asia. This research also suggested for an effective marketing and promotion strategy in pro- viding useful information that is the key to attract international tourists to travel long distances.

abstract = {A novel full wavefield processing method by using fully convolutional neural networks is presented. The full wavefield of propagating Lamb waves in the fibre-reinforced composite plate was simulated by the parallel spectral element method. It resembles a full wavefield measurements acquired on a surface of the plate by the scanning laser Doppler vibrometer. The aim of the proposed technique is an identification of delamination location, size and shape. It is achieved by pixel-wise image segmentation by using the end-to-end approach. It is possible because of the large dataset of Lamb wave propagation patterns resulting from interaction with delaminations of random location, size and shape. It is demonstrated that the proposed method, tested on numerical data, is performing better than conventional adaptive wavenumber filtering method which was developed in previous work. Moreover, it enables better automation of delamination identification so that the damage map can be created without user intervention. The method was also tested on experimental data acquired on the surface of the specimen in which delamination was artificially created by a Teflon insert. The obtained results with the deep learning approach show its capability to predict the delamination in the numerically generated dataset with high accuracy compared to the conventional damage detection approach. Furthermore, the deep learning model shows the ability to generalize to a further experiential set.},

abstract = {In this paper an application of Artificial Neural Networks and Probability Ellipse methods for damage detection using Lamb waves is presented. The wave propagation data are used to determine the location and degree of damage in metallic and composite plates. The structural components are to be instrumented with array of actuators and sensors (PCB) able to excite and record its dynamic response. A damage index, calculated from the measured wave propagation data in a reference state (baseline) and the current state, is introduced as a determinant of structural damage. The index is a relative measure comparing the two states of the structure under the same ambient conditions. The damage index increase its intensity when the damage size increase too. Moreover, its calculation in different paths associated with the Artificial Neural Networks or Probability Ellipse methods allow to identify position and entity of the damage. Two panels made by aluminum and fabric composite material have been used for tests. A damage entities simulated as through-thickness hole with diameter equal to 6. mm has been investigated for aluminium panel while three damage entities (through-thickness hole with size equal to 2.5. mm, 4.5. mm and 9. mm) have been investigated for that in composite material. In order to get a training, needful for the application of the ANN method, finite elements analysis have been performed for the aluminum panel taking into account several damage paths. Simulations have been performed in order to characterize the propagation path of the Lamb waves in composite plate changing the damage entities from hole diameter equal to 2.5. mm up to 9. mm. Damage index for each damage size for both simulations and tests will be compared. The potential applications of these methods in developing health monitoring systems in defects-critical structures and in composite material structures are discussed.},
