	{
		Composite laminates have a wide range of applications in various industries due to their good characteristics, such as:
		high strength, low density, light weight, and resistance to fatigue and corrosion, among others.
		
		However, composite laminates may encounter some defects, such as cracks, fibre breakage, and debonding.
		
		In particular, composite laminates are more sensitive to damage in the form of delamination due to weak transverse tensile and interlaminar shear strengths.
		
		Therefore, delaminations can seriously decrease the performance of composite structures.
		Accordingly, delamination detection in its early stages can significantly help to avoid catastrophic structural collapses.

		Now, to train my deep-learning models, I need a large data set of samples with different delamination sizes, locations, and shapes interacting with guided waves.
		And, I need to obtain the full wavefields of the guided wave propagation using the scanning laser Doppler vibrometer. 
		
		However, creating a real dataset with artificially modeled defects is very challenging, expensive, and time-consuming.
		
		Consequently, a large synthetic dataset was generated, resembling the measurements registered by the scanning laser Doppler vibrometer at the bottom surface of the plate as a response to the piezoelectric transducer excitation at the center of the plate..
		
		The synthetic dataset was created using the Mindlin-Reissner theory for thin plate analysis and the spectral element method to approximate the solution of wave propagation and their interaction with delamination.
		
		The animation on the left shows the generated meshes in which the  delamination is modelled in green and the piezoelectric transducer in red for each scenario.

		Computer vision has three main hierarchical levels of tasks: 
		
		The first level performs a classification or detection for the whole input and predicts one output.
		
		The second level is the localisation of the object that we are looking for. 
		
		The ultimate level of computer vision is to perform Pixel-wise image segmentation, in which each pixel in the input image is classified into its proper class.

%		Here, I present the architectures of all the deep learning models I've created that are based on the RMS image of the full wavefield.
%		
%		For further details about these models, kindly, I advise you to return to my thesis and my published papers. 
%		%		Both the Res-UNet and VGG16 encoder-decoders are autoencoders.
%		%		The main difference between them is the additional skip connections that were added to Res-Unet at the encoder and decoder levels. \\
%		%		FCN-DenseNet applies an encoder-decoder scheme with skip connections between the encoder and the decoder paths.
%		%		The main component in FCN-DenseNet is the dense block. 
%		%		The dense block is constructed from a varying number of convolutional layers. 
%		%		The purpose of the dense block is to concatenate feature maps of a layer with its output to emphasize spatial details information. \\		
%		%		The idea of PSPNet is to provide adequate global contextual information for pixel-level scene parsing by concatenating the local and global features together. 
%		%		Hence, a spatial pyramid pooling module was introduced to perform four different pooling levels with four different pool sizes. 
%		%		In this way, the pyramid pooling module can capture contextual features at different scales.\\		
%		%		GCN addresses the importance of having large kernels at the convolution operations for both localization and classification tasks for semantic segmentation.

	\note{
		Here, I present the developed autoencoder-ConvLSTM model, which takes a sequence of consecutive full wavefield frames of guided wave propagation as an input.
		
		To reduce the training complexity, I used a certain number of frames after the initial interaction of guided waves with the damage, as the delamination location is known.
		
		These selected frames, which contain the required features regarding the delamination shape and location, are fed into an encoder-decoder model at once using a time-distributed layer.
		
		Then, the output of the decoder is forwarded into the ConvLSTM layer, which handles time series data by learning long-term spatiotemporal features.
		
		For real-life situations where the damage location is unknown,  the full wavefield is tested through a sliding window that produces an intermediate output at a time.
		Finally, the root-mean-square formula is applied to all intermediate predictions to obtain the RMS damage map.

				For evaluating delamination identification
				\begin{itemize}
					\item Intersection over Union (IoU): 
					\begin{equation*}
						\textup{IoU}=\frac{Intersection}{Union}=\frac{\hat{Y} \cap Y}{\hat{Y} \cup Y}
						\label{eqn:iou}
					\end{equation*}
					\item Percentage area error $\epsilon$:
					\begin{equation*}

	\note{
		Now, to evaluate the developed models for delamination identification, 
		I used two metrics:
		The first metric is the mean intersection over union (also known as the Jaccard index), which calculates the area of intersection between actual and predicted values divided by the union of them.
		The second metric is the percentage area error \(\epsilon\), which calculates the percentage of the difference between actual and predicted areas.

	\note{
		This slide shows three numerical samples tested with the GCN model.
		For the first case, the delamination is barely visible by the naked eye, yet the model could identify the delamination with IoU = 0.71.
		For the second case, the IOU = 0.72, and for the third case, the IOU = .86
		Additionally, each animation shows all extracted feature maps from the RMS image input until we get the final prediction of the damage map.
		It's important to notice that GCN can identify the delamination with high accuracy and noise free.

		Here, I present the predicted results using the autoencoder ConvLSTM model compared to adaptive wavenumber filtering for the multiple delamination case.
		The animation on the left shows the full wavefield measured by the SLDV of 512 frames.
		The figure shows the damage map resulting from applying adaptive wavenumber filtering, and this figure shows its binary output with IoU = 0.04
		Figure shows the RMS of all intermediate predictions, and figure shows the binary RMS with IoU = 0.64
		It can be concluded that utilising animations of Lamb waves propagation has better outcomes for delamination identification than the processing of a single image representing signal energy or RMS.

	\note{
		As mentioned earlier, the scanning laser Doppler vibrometer is a well-known non-contact tool for the acquisition of the full wavefield of propagating guided waves.
		However, the process of acquiring the full wavefield of guided waves is time-consuming. 
		One possible solution to tackle this problem is to acquire the Lamb waves at low-resolution grid points, and then the full wavefield can be reconstructed at high resolution.
		Furthermore, I have compared my developed model of deep learning for super-resolution with the compressive sensing technique, which states that any signal can be reconstructed from a linear combination of random measurements.
		To acquire the low-resolution measurements, I have used two types of masks, as shown in the figure: random and jitter.
		The low-resolution measurements are far fewer than required by the Nyquist-Shannon sampling theory.

%	\begin{frame}{Evaluation metrics for DLSR model}
%		For evaluating the reconstructed HR full wavefield:
%		\begin{itemize}
%			\item Peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR):
%			\begin{equation*}
%				PSNR=20\log_{10}\left(\frac{R}{\sqrt{MSE}}\right)
%				\label{PSNR_}
%			\end{equation*}			
%			\item Pearson correlation coefficient (also known as Pearson's r):
%			\begin{equation*}
%				r_{xy} = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n}(x_i - \bar{x})(y_i-\bar{y})}{\sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^{n}(x_i - \bar{x})^2}\sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^{n}(y_i - \bar{y})^2}}
%				\label{Pearson_}
%			\end{equation*}
%		\end{itemize}
%	\end{frame}
%	%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%	\note
%	{
%		To evaluate the developed model, I used two metrics to measure the quality of the reconstructed high-resolution full wavefield frames:
%		\begin{itemize}
%			\item The first one is the peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR), which refers to the maximum possible power of a signal and the power of the distorting noise that affects the quality of its representation.
%			%			This equation depicts the mathematical representation of PSNR, where R is the maximum fluctuation value in the input image, and MSE is the mean squared error between the actual and predicted output.
%			%			
%			\item The second metric is the Pearson correlation coefficient (Pearson CC), which measures the linear relationship between two
%			variable sets \(X\) (represents the ground truth values) and \(Y\) (represents the predicted values) as shown in the below equation.
%			
%			%			Where \(n\) is the number of sample points,\(x_i, y_i\) are the individual value points representing the ground truth and predicted values, respectively, and \(\bar{x}\) and \(\bar{y}\) are the mean values of the sample and the prediction.
