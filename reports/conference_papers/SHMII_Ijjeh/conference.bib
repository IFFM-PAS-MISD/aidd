abstract = {We introduce Adam, an algorithm for first-order gradient-based optimization of stochastic objective functions, based on adaptive estimates of lower-order moments. The method is straightforward to implement, is computationally efficient, has little memory requirements, is invariant to diagonal rescaling of the gradients, and is well suited for problems that are large in terms of data and/or parameters. The method is also appropriate for non-stationary objectives and problems with very noisy and/or sparse gradients. The hyper-parameters have intuitive interpretations and typically require little tuning. Some connections to related algorithms, on which Adam was inspired, are discussed. We also analyze the theoretical convergence properties of the algorithm and provide a regret bound on the convergence rate that is comparable to the best known results under the online convex optimization framework. Empirical results demonstrate that Adam works well in practice and compares favorably to other stochastic optimization methods. Finally, we discuss AdaMax, a variant of Adam based on the infinity norm.},

abstract = {Delamination, i.e. the separation between layers that occurs by failure of the resin-rich interlaminar interface, is a direct consequence of the lack of out-of-plane reinforcements and, undoubtedly, the most common damage mode in laminated composites. Delaminations induced by low-velocity impacts are of primary concern in structural applications, since impact damage, often miss-detected, may propagate, impairing the load bearing capacity of the component, particularly under compressive loads. Preventing delamination, as well as delaying and limiting its propagation, are thus key issues in the design of composite structures. Over the last decades, many strategies have been proposed to address this problem. Among them, the introduction of through-thickness reinforcements (stitching, pinning and stapling) has proven to be effective in improving the interlaminar properties of composite materials. In particular, recent studies have shown that Z-pinning, which consists in inserting high stiffness pins through the thickness of uncured laminates, may significantly enhance the delamination resistance of laminated components. In this study, conventional and Z-pin reinforced [02/902]s graphite/epoxy laminates were subjected to low-velocity impact and compression after impact (CAI) tests in order to examine the effect of the reinforcements on the impact response and the residual post-impact properties of the laminate. The results show that Z-pinning significantly reduces the extent of delamination induced by impact, while, on the contrary, it appears to only marginally improve the post-impact compressive strength of the laminates.},

abstract = {Nondestructive evaluation (NDE) utilizes a variety of techniques to inspect various materials for defects without causing changes to the material. X-ray computed tomography (CT) produces large volumes of three dimensional image data. Using the task of identifying delaminations in carbon fiber reinforced polymer (CFRP) composite CT, this work shows that it is possible to automate the analysis of these large volumes of CT data using a machine learning model known as a convolutional neural network (CNN). Further, tests on simulated data sets show that with a robust set of experimental data, it may be possible to go beyond just identification and instead accurately characterize the size and shape of the delaminations with CNNs.},

abstract = {Structural health monitoring using ultrasonic guided waves relies on accurate interpretation of guided wave propagation to distinguish damage state indicators. However, traditional physics based models do not provide an accurate representation, and classic data driven techniques, such as a support vector machine, are too simplistic to capture the complex nature of ultrasonic guide waves. To address this challenge, this paper uses a deep learning interpretation of ultrasonic guided waves to achieve fast, accurate, and automated structural damaged detection. To achieve this, full wavefield scans of thin metal plates are used, half from the undamaged state and half from the damaged state. This data is used to train our deep network to predict the damage state of a plate with 99.98% accuracy given signals from just 10 spatial locations on the plate, as compared to that of a support vector machine (SVM), which achieved a 62% accuracy.},

These methods have dramatically improved the state-of-the-art in speech recognition, visual object recognition, object detection and many other domains such as drug discovery and genomics. Deep learning discovers intricate structure in large data sets by using the backpropagation algorithm to indicate how a machine should change its internal parameters that are used to compute the representation in each layer from the representation in the previous layer. Deep convolutional nets have brought about breakthroughs in processing images, video, speech and audio, whereas recurrent nets have shone light on sequential data such as text and speech.},
