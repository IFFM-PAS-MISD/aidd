\section{Conclusions}
\label{conclusion}
In this research work, we presented a novel deep learning-based surrogate 
model. 
The developed model adopts the architecture of autoencoder-decoder in 
conjunction with the ConvLSTM for the prediction of full wavefield containing 
delamination. 
In the proposed model, the encoder and decoder parts of the proposed model 
are trained jointly on full wavefield containing delamination. 
Then the encoder is training separately on reference data without delamination. 
The delamination information in the form of binary images is also provided 
along with the reference images to the encoder part for training the encoder, 
and the final prediction of frames containing delamination.
In simple words, this deep learning based surrogate models takes full wavefield 
frames without delamination as input and predicts full wavefields containing 
delamination.
The proposed model performed well as proved by the results.
The proposed model is helpful for the prediction the full wavefield data from 
the time of excitation initiation to the desired simulation time. 
The predicted wavefield from the proposed architecture can be used for NDT and 
SHM inverse problems.
Where, there will be no need to acquire the full wavefield data from the 
beginning which is very expensive and time-consuming task.
