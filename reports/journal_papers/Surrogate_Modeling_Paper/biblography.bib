After a brief introduction, the discussion focuses on the significant types of aerospace composite damage, which is substantially different from the damage usually encountered in aerospace metallic structures. Tension, compression, fastener holes, impact, fatigue damage types are discussed. Damage in composite sandwich structures and adhesive composite joints are also reviewed. The chapter continues with a presentation of the major sensor classes used in SHM practice with focus on advanced sensors, such as optical fiber Bragg gratings (FBG) and piezoelectric wafer active sensors (PWAS). Electrical sensing methods for composites SHM are also discussed. The last part of the chapter discusses the methods of SHM implementation, such as passive sensing SHM, active sensing SHM, local-area sensing with the electromechanical impedance spectroscopy (EMIS), active sensing SHM with electrical methods, and direct methods for impact damage detection. The chapter finishes with a summary, conclusion, and suggestions for further work.},

However, the nondestructive testing of nonmetallic materials still needs further study. In this paper, an analysis of the time domain characteristics of rubber materials using terahertz detection technology was carried out, obtaining different defect rubber material spectral characteristics as well as imaging results and data. The results show that the THz spectrum imaging technique can detect the thickness of rubber material in the 0.1 $\sim$ 4.0 terahertz band, and the image is clear and the resolution high. Meanwhile the time domain waveform obtained is sensitive to the debonding defects of the sample rubber, is suitable for judging the overall performance of the rubber inner defect detection, and can provide the scientific basis for rubber material performance.},

abstract = {This paper presents the use of a novel through-transmission ultrasonic (TTU) Acoustography non-destructive evaluation (NDE) method to detect foreign object inclusion (FOI) defects in graphite epoxy composite laminates. The study employed three different composite test standards with varied size FOI defects embedded at varying depth within the composite laminates. For validation, Acoustography results were directly compared with conventional immersion TTU testing and infrared thermography (IRT) methods. From results obtained, it was demonstrated that the Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) measurements for Acoustography were more than 6:1 and were in good correlation with immersion TTU and IRT results. The defect sizing ability of TTU Acoustography for FOI defects in graphite epoxy composite laminates were also in strong correlation with immersion TTU and IRT techniques. Finally, for the three laboratory systems employed in this study, typical panel TTU Acoustography inspection time was just about three minutes to scan a 300 mm × 300 mm (11.8″ × 11.8″) area, which was more than three times faster compared to IRT and sixty times faster to conventional immersion TTU C-Scan techniques. This is a very significant finding for the reason that Acoustography is being developed as a faster, more efficient, and affordable alternative to traditional ultrasonic inspection systems for composite manufacturing quality control and quality assurance (QC/QA) and field maintenance of composite structure applications.},

Bringing together materials mechanics and modeling, this book provides a complete guide to damage, fatigue and failure of composite materials. Early chapters focus on the underlying principles governing composite damage, reviewing basic equations and mechanics theory, before describing mechanisms of damage such as cracking, breakage and buckling. In subsequent chapters, the physical mechanisms underlying the formation and progression of damage under mechanical loads are described with ample experimental data, and micro- and macro-level damage models are combined. Finally, fatigue of composite materials is discussed using fatigue-life diagrams. While there is a special emphasis on polymer matrix composites, metal and ceramic matrix composites are also described. Outlining methods for more reliable design of composite structures, this is a valuable resource for engineers and materials scientists in industry and academia.},

@article{staszewski2009health,
abstract = {Impact damage is one of the major concerns in maintenance of aircraft structures built from composite materials. Damage detection in composite materials can be divided into active and passive approaches. The active approach is usually based on various non-destructive techniques utilizing actuators and/or receivers. In contrast passive approaches do not involve any actuators; receivers are used to "sense and/or hear" any perturbations caused by possible hidden damage. Often strain data are used to localize impacts and estimate their energy. The assumption is that damage occurs above well-defined energy of impacts. The paper illustrates one active and one passive method recently developed for impact damage detection. The first method, based on guided ultrasonic waves, utilises 3-D laser vibrometry and does not require any signal processing. Simple laser scans, revealing the change in Lamb wave response amplitudes, have been used to locate delamination and estimate its severity in a composite plate. In contrast, the second method does not require any sophisticated instrumentation but relies on advanced signal processing. An array of piezoceramic sensors has been to detect strain waves transmitted from an impact applied to the composite aircraft structure. The modified multilateration procedure with Genetic Algorithms has been used to locate impact position. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {This paper presents a review of advances in the field of Sensor Placement Optimisation (SPO) strategies for Structural Health Monitoring (SHM). This task has received a great deal of attention in the research literature, from initial foundations in the control engineering literature to adoption in a modal or system identification context in the structural dynamics community. Recent years have seen an increasing focus on methods that are specific to damage identification, with the maximisation of correct classification outcomes being prioritised. The objectives of this article are to present the SPO for SHM problem, to provide an overview of the current state of the art in this area, and to identify promising emergent trends within the literature. The key conclusions drawn are that there remains a great deal of scope for research in a number of key areas, including the development of methods that promote robustness to modelling uncertainty, benign effects within measured data, and failures within the sensor network. There also remains a paucity of studies that demonstrate practical, experimental evaluation of developed SHM system designs. Finally, it is argued that the pursuit of novel or highly efficient optimisation methods may be considered to be of secondary importance in an SPO context, given that the optimisation effort is expended at the design stage.},

First, a pitch-catch method using a pair of piezoelectric actuator and sensor is introduced to generate a damage indeX which can be used to characterize damage at a known location. Tests on airbus fuselage panels are conducted to verify the method and damage indeX. The damage indeX relates changes in the energy content of a specific Lamb wave mode selected by group velocity analysis to the eXtent of damage. Second, an imaging method based on multiple pitch-catch information, a network of piezoelectric actuator/sensors, is presented for characterizing damage (location and size) without need for a structural or damage model. The imaging method with an autofocusing feature is applied to aluminum plates and a stiffened composite panel for method verification. {\textcopyright} 2008 Sage Publications.},

This paper proposes the use of the value of information and the relative expected information gain as optimality criteria to determine the best number and positions of sensors, respectively. The proposed methodology is general, but in this paper it is specialized for ultrasonic guided-wave optimal system configuration. Two case studies are used to illustrate the suitability of the proposed methodology in providing the optimal sensor configuration of an ultrasonic guided-wave based structural health monitoring system. The results confirm the value of information as an efficient and rational index to compare among different sensor positioning strategies, while accounting for the underlying modeling and measurement uncertainties. As key contribution, a novel framework that trades-off between amount and cost of information is provided. The results show that geometrically unconstrained sensor configurations are preferred, since they provide a healthier balance between the amount of information and the benefit of such information.},

@article{Radzienski2019a,
abstract = {Composite materials are widely used in the industry, and the interest of this material is growing rapidly, due to its light weight, strength and various other desired mechanical properties. However, composite materials are prone to production defects and other defects originated during exploitation, which may jeopardize the safety of such a structure. Thus, non-destructive evaluation methods that are material-independent and suitable for a wide range of defects identification are needed. In this paper, a technique for damage characterization in composite plates is proposed. In the presented non-destructive testing method, guided waves are excited by a piezoelectric transducer, attached to tested specimens, and measured by a scanning laser Doppler vibrometer in a dense grid of points. By means of signal processing, irregularities in wavefield images caused by any material defects are extracted and used for damage characterization. The effectiveness of the proposed technique is validated on four different composite panels: Carbon fiber-reinforced polymer, glass fiber-reinforced polymer, composite reinforced by randomly-oriented short glass fibers and aluminum-honeycomb core sandwich composite. Obtained results confirm its versatility and efficacy in damage characterization in various types of composite plates.},

@article{Girolamo2018a,
abstract = {A fully non-contact laser-based nondestructive inspection (NDI) system is developed to detect and visualize damage in structures. The study focuses on the size quantification and characterization of a barely visible impact damage (BVID) in a honeycomb composite panel. The hardware consists of a Q-switched Nd:YAG pulse laser that probes the panel by generating broadband guided waves via thermo-elastic expansion. The laser, in combination with a set of galvano-mirrors is used to raster scan over a two-dimensional surface covering the damaged region of an impacted quasi-isotropic [60/0/−60]s honeycomb composite panel. The out-of-plane velocities are measured at a fixed location normal to the surface by a laser Doppler vibrometer (LDV). An ultrasonic full wavefield assembled from the three-dimensional space-time data matrix in the interrogated area is first acquired and then processed for imaging the impacted damage area. A wavenumber filtering technique in terms of wave vectors is applied to distinguish the forward and backward wavefields in the wavenumber-frequency domain. A zero-lag cross correlation (ZLCC) imaging condition is then employed in the space-frequency domain for damage imaging. The ZLCC imaging condition consists of cross correlating the incident and reflected wavefields in the entire scanned region. The condition not only images the damage boundary between incident and reflected waves outside the damage region but also, for longer time windows, enables to capture the momentary standing waves formed within the damaged region. The ZLCC imaging condition imaged two delaminated region: a main delamination, which was a skewed elliptic with major and minor axis lengths roughly 17 mm and 10 mm respectively, and a secondary delamination region approximately 6 mm by 4 mm, however, which can only be shown at higher frequency range around 80–95 kHz. To conclude, the ZLCC results were in very good agreement with ultrasonic C-scan and X-ray computed tomographic (X-ray CT) scan results. Since the imaging condition is performed in the space-frequency domain, the imaging from ZLCC can also reveal resonance modes which are shown in the main delaminated area by windowing a narrow frequency band sequentially.},

@article{rogge2013characterization,
abstract = {Delaminations in composite laminates resulting from impact events may be accompanied by minimal indication of damage at the surface. As such, inspections are required to ensure defects are within allowable limits. Conventional ultrasonic scanning techniques have been shown to effectively characterize the size and depth of delaminations but require physical contact with the structure and considerable setup time. Alternatively, a non-contact scanning laser vibrometer may be used to measure guided wave propagation in the laminate structure generated by permanently bonded transducers. A local Fourier domain analysis method is presented for processing guided wavefield data to estimate spatially dependent wavenumber values, which can be used to determine delamination depth. The technique is applied to simulated wavefields and results are analyzed to determine limitations of the technique with regards to determining defect size and depth. Based on simulation results, guidelines for application of the technique are developed. Finally, experimental wavefield data is obtained in quasi-isotropic carbon fiber reinforced polymer (CFRP) laminates with impact damage. The recorded wavefields are analyzed and wavenumber is measured to an accuracy of up to 8.5% in the region of shallow delaminations. These results show the promise of local wavenumber domain analysis to characterize the depth of delamination damage in composite laminates. The technique can find application in automated vehicle health assurance systems with potential for high detection rates and greatly reduced operator effort and setup time. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Batch Normalization (BatchNorm) is a widely adopted technique that enables faster and more stable training of deep neural networks (DNNs). Despite its pervasiveness, the exact reasons for BatchNorm's effectiveness are still poorly understood. The popular belief is that this effectiveness stems from controlling the change of the layers' input distributions during training to reduce the so-called “internal covariate shift”. In this work, we demonstrate that such distributional stability of layer inputs has little to do with the success of BatchNorm. Instead, we uncover a more fundamental impact of BatchNorm on the training process: it makes the optimization landscape significantly smoother. This smoothness induces a more predictive and stable behavior of the gradients, allowing for faster training.},
