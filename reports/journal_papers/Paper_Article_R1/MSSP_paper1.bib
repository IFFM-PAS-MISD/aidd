abstract = {Lamb wave based damage detection techniques have been widely used in composite structures. In particular, these techniques usually rely on reference signals, which are significantly influenced by the operational and environmental conditions. To solve this issue, this paper presents a baseline-free damage inspection method based on the reciprocity principle. If a localized nonlinear scatterer exists along the wave path, the reciprocity breaks down. Through estimating the loss of reciprocity, the delamination could be detected. A reciprocity index (RI), which compares the discrepancy between the signal received in transducer B when emitting from transducer A and the signal received in A when the same source is located in B, is established to quantitatively analyze the reciprocity. Experimental results show that the RI value of a damaged path is much higher than that of a healthy path. In addition, the effects of the parameters of excitation signal (i.e., central frequency and bandwidth) and the position of delamination on the RI value are discussed. Furthermore, a RI based probabilistic imaging algorithm is proposed for detecting delamination damage of composite plates without reference signals. Finally, the effectiveness of this baseline-free damage detection method is validated by an experimental example.},

abstract = {This experimental study presents Lamb wave based diagnostics of damage in a composite plate using time reversal of signals for baseline-free damage detection. A modified time reversal method (MTRM) is developed which requires only one transducer to actuate signals and the other transducer acts as a sensor for any signal path. An 8-layer symmetric cross-ply carbon-epoxy composite plate is fabricated and four PZT actuators/sensors are surface bonded at the corners of the plate. A 20 kHz, 9.5 cycle tone burst signal is used to generate fundamental asymmetric Lamb waves with high signal-to-noise ratio and low dispersion. Theoretical analysis and experimental measurements show that conventional time reversal method (TRM) and the MTRM yield identical signals at the end of time reversal. The composite plate is impacted incrementally with a steel ball to cause three levels of damage and MTRM is applied for prediction of damage severity. Results show that magnitudes of the two damage indices used are directly correlated to the severity of damage along any signal path. The development of MTRM paves the way for implementing time reversal of signals using a single actuator and multiple sensors, including non-contact sensor such as a laser vibrometer. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {The tomography technique is an effective way to quantitatively evaluate damage from reconstruction imaging in structure health monitoring (SHM). The reconstruction algorithm for the probabilistic inspection of damage (RAPID) algorithm based on the signal difference coefficient (SDC) feature is a promising approach due to its superior performance. This paper focuses on the influence of different patterns of PZT (Lead Zirconate Titanate) sensor array configurations, i.e., the circular, square, and parallel array, on reconstruction image qualities for evaluating hole and crack damage. Variable shape parameters are applied to account for the unequal damage distances of different actuator-sensor pairs. Considering the directionality scattering fields of cracks, the angular scattering pattern of the SDC values are studied by simulation. The SDC variations for different groups of sensing paths at the same actuator are applied to predict the crack orientation. An improved RAPID algorithm is proposed by defining an additional SDC value of 1 in the path along the predicted crack orientation, which is determined by the point of the actuator causing the minimal SDC variation and the center point of the initial reconstruction image of the crack. The results show that the improved RAPID algorithm is effective for the evaluation of crack damage. Reconstruction image qualities with three PZT sensor array configurations for both holes and cracks are compared. The research is significant for selecting the PZT sensor array configuration in SHM.},

abstract = {A spatially distributed array of single element piezoelectric transducers is considered for monitoring the integrity of plate-like structures over large areas. When these permanently attached transducers are driven with an impulsive excitation, broadband Lamb waves are generated and received signals are complex, typically containing multiple modes as well as many boundary reflections. The complexity of the signals, including dispersive effects, can be reduced by digital bandpass filtering, and changes in these filtered signals over time can be monitored to detect and localize damage. Results are reported here from an experimental study whereby artificial damage was introduced in an aluminum plate in the form of through holes drilled at various locations. Time shift averaging algorithms were applied to differential signals filtered at multiple frequencies, resulting in many images for the same structural state, and these images were fused to improve damage localization and background noise. Individual and fused images were analyzed to quantify their ability to localize damage. The results show the efficacy of the imaging method as well as the significant improvement resulting from image fusion. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Permanently attached piezoelectric sensors arranged in a spatially distributed array are under consideration for structural health monitoring systems incorporating active ultrasonic methods. Most damage detection and localization methods that have been proposed are based upon comparing monitored signals to baselines recorded from the structure prior to initiation of damage. To be effective, this comparison process must take into account any conditions other than damage that have changed the ultrasonic signals. Proposed here is a two-step process whereby damage is first detected and is then localized and characterized. The detection strategy considers the long time behavior of the signals in the diffuse-like regime where distinct echoes can no longer be identified. The localization strategy is to generate images of damage based upon the early time regime when discrete echoes from boundary reflections and scattering sites are meaningful. Results are shown for an aluminum plate with artificial damage introduced in combination with temperature variations. The loss of local temporal coherence combined with an optimal baseline selection procedure is shown to be effective for the detection of damage, and a delay-and-sum imaging method applied to the residual signals both localizes the damage and provides characterization information. {\textcopyright} 2008 IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract = {A fully non-contact laser-based nondestructive inspection (NDI) system is developed to detect and visualize damage in structures. The study focuses on the size quantification and characterization of a barely visible impact damage (BVID) in a honeycomb composite panel. The hardware consists of a Q-switched Nd:YAG pulse laser that probes the panel by generating broadband guided waves via thermo-elastic expansion. The laser, in combination with a set of galvano-mirrors is used to raster scan over a two-dimensional surface covering the damaged region of an impacted quasi-isotropic [60/0/−60]s honeycomb composite panel. The out-of-plane velocities are measured at a fixed location normal to the surface by a laser Doppler vibrometer (LDV). An ultrasonic full wavefield assembled from the three-dimensional space-time data matrix in the interrogated area is first acquired and then processed for imaging the impacted damage area. A wavenumber filtering technique in terms of wave vectors is applied to distinguish the forward and backward wavefields in the wavenumber-frequency domain. A zero-lag cross correlation (ZLCC) imaging condition is then employed in the space-frequency domain for damage imaging. The ZLCC imaging condition consists of cross correlating the incident and reflected wavefields in the entire scanned region. The condition not only images the damage boundary between incident and reflected waves outside the damage region but also, for longer time windows, enables to capture the momentary standing waves formed within the damaged region. The ZLCC imaging condition imaged two delaminated region: a main delamination, which was a skewed elliptic with major and minor axis lengths roughly 17 mm and 10 mm respectively, and a secondary delamination region approximately 6 mm by 4 mm, however, which can only be shown at higher frequency range around 80–95 kHz. To conclude, the ZLCC results were in very good agreement with ultrasonic C-scan and X-ray computed tomographic (X-ray CT) scan results. Since the imaging condition is performed in the space-frequency domain, the imaging from ZLCC can also reveal resonance modes which are shown in the main delaminated area by windowing a narrow frequency band sequentially.},

The frequency-wavenumber representations of the guided wavefields show that different wavenumbers are present in the delaminated plate, compared to a pristine case. The wavenumbers are correlated to trapped waves in the delamination region. Novel approaches for imaging the composite panels using guided waves are discussed and demonstrated for quantitative evaluation of the delamination damage. A filter reconstruction imaging method is shown to provide a rapid technique to locate delamination damage by showing where guided wave energy is trapped. A spatial wavenumber-based imaging algorithm is applied to calculate wavenumber values at each spatial location and highlights the delamination damage as regions with larger wavenumber values. The imaging approaches are demonstrated using experimental data from a plate with a simulated delamination (teflon insert) and from a plate containing impact-induced delamination damage. The methods are also applied to a multiple mode guided wave case to demonstrate application to complex wave cases.},

abstract = {Composite materials are widely used in the industry, and the interest of this material is growing rapidly, due to its light weight, strength and various other desired mechanical properties. However, composite materials are prone to production defects and other defects originated during exploitation, which may jeopardize the safety of such a structure. Thus, non-destructive evaluation methods that are material-independent and suitable for a wide range of defects identification are needed. In this paper, a technique for damage characterization in composite plates is proposed. In the presented non-destructive testing method, guided waves are excited by a piezoelectric transducer, attached to tested specimens, and measured by a scanning laser Doppler vibrometer in a dense grid of points. By means of signal processing, irregularities in wavefield images caused by any material defects are extracted and used for damage characterization. The effectiveness of the proposed technique is validated on four different composite panels: Carbon fiber-reinforced polymer, glass fiber-reinforced polymer, composite reinforced by randomly-oriented short glass fibers and aluminum-honeycomb core sandwich composite. Obtained results confirm its versatility and efficacy in damage characterization in various types of composite plates.},

abstract = {This research is related to a signal processing of full wavefield data as an effective tool for detection, localization and visualization of a crack growth in thin-walled structures. Full wavefield data of propagating Lamb waves in structures such as plates and shells made out of metallic alloys and composite laminates contain a wealth of information about wave pattern anomalies due to occurrence of a damage. The aim is to demonstrate a method for enhancing damage visualization in structures such that estimation of the length and orientation of the crack can be easily obtained. The proposed signal processing involves application of discrete fast Fourier transform, wavenumber domain filtering and inverse discrete Fourier transform. The method is further enhanced by a technique for compensation of the wave attenuation so that the effects of structural damage have the same influence regardless of the location. The concept is first illustrated on numerically simulated data, and then tested on experimental results. In the experiments, full wavefield measurements are obtained using a scanning laser Doppler vibrometer, which allows the measurement of displacements and/or velocities along three axes over a user-defined grid. In the proposed method only out-of-plane velocities are used. Tests performed on simple aluminum and composite plates with artificially introduced longitudinal cracks confirm the effectiveness of the method and its potential for application to the inspection of a variety of structural components. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Delamination damage can occur internally, where it is not visible to the naked eye. Development of reliable, quantitative techniques for detecting delamination damage in laminated composite components will be imperative for safe and functional optimally designed next-generation composite structures. In this article, we study the potential of using Lamb waves for delamination detection and quantification, using model-assisted data acquisition. Novel wavenumber analysis approaches are developed and discussed to show how they can be used to investigate Lamb wave interactions with delaminated plies. Ultrasonic wave simulations are implemented to provide both in-plane and out-of-plane wave motion for the wavenumber studies. The out-of-plane results are verified against data obtained from experimental tests. It is found that the wavenumber methods can not only determine the delaminated region of the plate and its length, but can also identify the plies between which the delamination occurs. We envision that the wavenumber approaches can lead to a complete delamination quantification in the future.},

Then, hidden damages are identified and visualized through adoption of a standing wave filter, which can isolate damage-induced standing waves from the obtained wavefield. The proposed technique has following advantages over the existing techniques: (1) it does not require any sensor installation; (2) it is noninvasive, rapidly deployable and applicable to harsh environments; and (3) it can visualize damage with high spatial resolution without any baseline data, which enables automated and intuitive damage diagnosis. The feasibility of the proposed technique is demonstrated by visualizing a debonding in a carbon fiber reinforced plastic aircraft wing and a delamination in a glass fiber reinforced plastic wind turbine blade.

This is a severe restriction in many fields of engineering such as aerospace or aeronautics, where typically one needs to monitor composite structures with varying mechanical properties and complex geometries. This is particularly true in the case of multiscale composite materials, where anisotropy and material gradients may be present. Here, we provide an impact localization algorithm based on time reversal and laser vibrometry to cope with this type of complexity. The proposed approach is shown to be insensitive to local elastic wave velocity or geometrical features. The technique is based on the correlation of the measured impact response and a set of measured test data acquired at various grid points along the specimen surface, allowing high resolution in the determination of the impact point. We present both numerical finite element simulations and experimental measurements to support the proposed procedure, showing successful implementation on an eccentrically stiffened aluminum plate.

abstract = {Abstract Long-haul travel does not constitute an obstacle for tourists to travel and is fast gaining the attention of tourists in new and unique experiences. This study was conducted to identify the long-haul travel motivation by international tourists to Penang. A total of 400 respondents participated in this survey, conducted around the tourist attractions in Penang, using cluster random sampling. However, only 370 questionnaires were only used for this research. Data were analysed using SPSS software 22 version. The findings, ‘knowledge and novelty seeking' were the main push factors that drove long-haul travel by international tourists to Penang. Meanwhile, the main pull factor that attracts long- haul travel by international tourists to Penang was its ‘culture and history'. Additionally, there were partly direct and significant relationships between socio-demographic, trip characteristics and travel motivation (push factors and pull factors). Overall, this study identified the long-haul travel motivations by international tourists to Penang based on socio-demographic, trip characteristics and travel motivation and has indirectly helped in understanding the long-haul travel market particularly for Penang and Southeast Asia. This research also suggested for an effective marketing and promotion strategy in pro- viding useful information that is the key to attract international tourists to travel long distances.

abstract = {Structural health monitoring using ultrasonic guided waves relies on accurate interpretation of guided wave propagation to distinguish damage state indicators. However, traditional physics based models do not provide an accurate representation, and classic data driven techniques, such as a support vector machine, are too simplistic to capture the complex nature of ultrasonic guide waves. To address this challenge, this paper uses a deep learning interpretation of ultrasonic guided waves to achieve fast, accurate, and automated structural damaged detection. To achieve this, full wavefield scans of thin metal plates are used, half from the undamaged state and half from the damaged state. This data is used to train our deep network to predict the damage state of a plate with 99.98{\%} accuracy given signals from just 10 spatial locations on the plate, as compared to that of a support vector machine (SVM), which achieved a 62{\%} accuracy.},

abstract = {Composite materials are heterogeneous in nature and suffer from complex non-linear modes of failure, such as delamination, matrix crack, fiber-breakage, and voids, among others. The early detection of damage in composite structures, such as airplanes, is imperative to avoid catastrophic failure and tragic consequences. This paper reports on the use of machine learning techniques for the damage assessment (i.e., detection, quantification, and localization) of smart composite structures. The success of the machine learning paradigm for damage assessment depends on the representational capability of the discriminative features for the problems of interest. However, from a practical standpoint, it is not possible to define a global or superset of discriminative features that could discriminate between damaged and undamaged states of the structures, and simultaneously make a distinction between various modes of failures. In addition, one machine learning algorithm may show optimum performance for the discriminative features of a particular problem but fails for others. This article focuses on a review of discriminative features and the corresponding machine learning algorithms (both supervised and unsupervised), for various types of damage in smart composite structures.},

Our V2CNet has two branches and aims at understanding the demonstration video in a fine-grained manner. The first branch has the encoder-decoder architecture to encode the visual features and sequentially generate the output words as a command, while the second branch uses a Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN) to learn the fine-grained actions. By jointly training both branches, the network is able to model the sequential information of the command, while effectively encodes the fine-grained actions. The experimental results on our new large-scale dataset show that V2CNet outperforms recent state-of-the-art methods by a substantial margin, while its output can be applied in real robotic applications.

abstract = {Structural health monitoring has received remarkable attention due to the arising structural safety problems. Most of these structural health problems are accumulative damages such as slight changes in structural deformations which are very hard to be detected. In addition, the complexity of real structure and environmental noises make structural health monitoring more difficult. Existing methods largely use various types of sensors to collect useful parameters and then train a machine learning model to diagnose damage level and location, in which a large amount of training data are needed for the model training, while the labeled data are rare in the real world. To overcome this problem, sparse coding is employed in this paper to achieve structural health monitoring of a bridge equipped with a wireless sensor network, so that a large amount of unlabeled examples can be used to train a feature extractor based on the sparse coding algorithm. Features learned from sparse coding are then used to train a neural network classifier to distinguish different statuses of the bridge. Experimental results show the sparse coding-based deep learning algorithm achieves higher accuracy for structural health monitoring under the same level of environmental noises, compared with some existing methods.},

abstract = {A number of image processing techniques (IPTs) have been implemented for detecting civil infrastructure defects to partially replace human-conducted onsite inspections. These IPTs are primarily used to manipulate images to extract defect features, such as cracks in concrete and steel surfaces. However, the extensively varying real-world situations (e.g., lighting and shadow changes) can lead to challenges to the wide adoption of IPTs. To overcome these challenges, this article proposes a vision-based method using a deep architecture of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for detecting concrete cracks without calculating the defect features. As CNNs are capable of learning image features automatically, the proposed method works without the conjugation of IPTs for extracting features. The designed CNN is trained on 40 K images of 256 × 256 pixel resolutions and, consequently, records with about 98{\%} accuracy. The trained CNN is combined with a sliding window technique to scan any image size larger than 256 × 256 pixel resolutions. The robustness and adaptability of the proposed approach are tested on 55 images of 5,888 × 3,584 pixel resolutions taken from a different structure which is not used for training and validation processes under various conditions (e.g., strong light spot, shadows, and very thin cracks). Comparative studies are conducted to examine the performance of the proposed CNN using traditional Canny and Sobel edge detection methods. The results show that the proposed method shows quite better performances and can indeed find concrete cracks in realistic situations.},

The generalization performance of the neural network is examined by a process of 'leave-one-out' cross-validation and diverse factors are discussed, based on which the optimization of the neural network architecture is evaluated.

abstract = {Statistical pattern recognition methodologies have gained considerable attention for Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) applications to detect changes in a structure (e.g. damage). For most of such applications, outlier analysis of the damage sensitive features obtained from the SHM data is used to detect the changes in the structure. There are a number of different approaches used by different research groups and it is widely accepted that success of a certain methodology may depend on the structure and/or structural change to be identified. Therefore, it is very important that promising methodologies are verified by using different test structures and damage cases. The main objective of this study is to investigate statistical pattern recognition methods in the context of SHM using different laboratory structures. Time series modeling, i.e. auto-regressive models, is used in conjunction with Mahalanobis distance-based outlier detection algorithms to identify different types of structural changes on different test structures. Similar approaches were reported in the literature but here the methodology is modified by using random decrement functions to eliminate the effects of the exogenous input. Then a number of tests are conducted by using two different test structures in laboratory conditions in order to evaluate the results in a comparable fashion. The first test specimen is a simply supported steel beam where the second structure is a highly redundant steel grid structure. Various damage conditions are simulated by using these structures. The ambient vibration data is analyzed by using the methodology described and results are presented. Finally, the advantages and drawbacks of the methodology are discussed in the light of experimental results. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Lamb waves are dispersive and multi-modal, which makes the interpretation of Lamb wave signals very difficult in either the time or frequency domain. In the this article, we present our studies on Lamb wave propagation characterization and crack detection using a hybrid lead zirconate titanate (PZT)-laser vibrometer system and frequency-wave number analysis. A scanning laser Doppler vibrometer is used to acquiring high-resolution time-space Lamb wavefield excited by a PZT actuator. The recorded wavefield is then transformed to frequency-wave number domain by two-dimensional Fourier transform. Wave spectrum in the frequency-wave number domain shows clear distinction among Lamb wave modes being present. These concepts are illustrated through several experimental tests. However, the space information is lost during this transformation. A short-space two-dimensional Fourier transform is then adopted to obtain the frequency-wave number spectra at various spatial locations, resulting in the space-frequency-wave number representation, which can show how the frequency-wave number component varies with respect to space dimension. It provides a means to study the wave propagation from the perspective of wave number domain. The space-frequency-wave number analysis has successfully been used for the study of wave interaction with structural discontinuity and crack detection on an aluminum plate. {\textcopyright} The Author(s) 2013.},

In this paper, we present a network and training strategy that relies on the strong use of data augmentation to use the available annotated samples more efficiently. The architecture consists of a contracting path to capture context and a symmetric expanding path that enables precise localization. We show that such a network can be trained end-to-end from very few images and outperforms the prior best method (a sliding-window convolutional network) on the ISBI challenge for segmentation of neuronal structures in electron microscopic stacks. Using the same network trained on transmitted light microscopy images (phase contrast and DIC) we won the ISBI cell tracking challenge 2015 in these categories by a large margin. Moreover, the network is fast. Segmentation of a 512x512 image takes less than a second on a recent GPU.

abstract = {Training Deep Neural Networks is complicated by the fact that the distribution of each layer's inputs changes during training, as the parameters of the previous layers change. This slows down the training by requiring lower learning rates and careful parameter initialization, and makes it notoriously hard to train models with saturating nonlinearities. We refer to this phenomenon as internal covariate shift, and address the problem by normalizing layer inputs. Our method draws its strength from making normalization a part of the model architecture and performing the normalization for each training mini-batch. Batch Normalization allows us to use much higher learning rates and be less careful about initialization, and in some cases eliminates the need for Dropout. Applied to a state-of-the-art image classification model, Batch Normalization achieves the same accuracy with 14 times fewer training steps, and beats the original model by a significant margin. Using an ensemble of batch-normalized networks, we improve upon the best published result on ImageNet classification: reaching 4.82{\%} top-5 test error, exceeding the accuracy of human raters.},

The method is straightforward to implement, is computationally efficient, has little memory requirements, is invariant to diagonal rescaling of the gradients, and is well suited for problems that are large in terms of data and/or parameters. The method is also appropriate for non-stationary objectives and problems with very noisy and/or sparse gradients. The hyper-parameters have intuitive interpretations and typically require little tuning. Some connections to related algorithms, on which Adam was inspired, are discussed. We also analyze the theoretical convergence properties of the algorithm and provide a regret bound on the convergence rate that is comparable to the best known results under the online convex optimization framework. Empirical results demonstrate that Adam works well in practice and compares favorably to other stochastic optimization methods. Finally, we discuss AdaMax, a variant of Adam based on the infinity norm.},

abstract = {This paper presents the application of Lamb waves to inspect damage in composite laminates. The proposed methodology employs a network of transducers that are used to sequentially scan the structure before and after the presence of damage by transmitting and receiving Lamb wave pulses. A damage localization image is reconstructed by analyzing the cross-correlation of the scatter signal envelope with the excitation pulse envelope for each transducer pair. A potential damage area is then reconstructed by superimposing the image observed from each actuator and sensor signal path. Both numerical and experimental case studies are used to verify the proposed methodology for composite laminates. Three-dimensional finite element models with a transducer network consisting of four transducer elements are used in the numerical case studies. The experimental case studies employ a transducer network using four piezoelectric transducers as transmitter elements and a laser vibrometer to measure the response signals at four locations close to the transducers. The results show that the method enables the reliable detection of structural damage with locating inaccuracies of the order of a few millimeters inside as well as outside of an inspection area of 100 × 100mm2. {\textcopyright} 2009 IOP Publishing Ltd.},

However, in order to utilise these waves fully a basic understanding of their propagation in composites is required. The propagation of Lamb waves in composites is complicated by the anisotropic lay-up which can lead to the speed of the Lamb mode being dependent on the laminate lay-up and the direction of wave propagation. This study concentrated on the fundamental symmetric mode, S0, and the fundamental anti-symmetric mode, A0. A one-dimensional finite-element model has been developed to solve for Lamb wave solutions in anisotropic layered structures. The calculated dispersion curves for various composite lay-ups are presented together with plots of the through-thickness particle and stress component amplitudes. For the S0 mode, the changes in the stress distributions and particle displacements as the frequency increases are described. Experimental measurements of the S0 group velocity for various laminate lay-ups are compared to the predicted values from the model. The work concludes with a discussion of the implications of these results when Lamb waves are utilised for impact damage detection.},

Lamb wave measurements can propagate over long distances and are sensitive to the desired in-plane elastic properties of the material. This paper describes two studies which monitor fatigue damage and two studies which monitor thermal damage in composites using Lamb waves. In the fatigue studies, the Lamb wave velocity is compared to modulus measurements obtained using strain gage measurements in the first experiment and the velocity is monitored along with the crack density in the second. In the thermal damage studies, one examines samples which were exposed to varying temperatures for a three minute duration and the second includes rapid thermal damage in composites by intense laser beams.

We define and detail the space of fully convolutional networks, explain their application to spatially dense prediction tasks, and draw connections to prior models. We adapt contemporary classification networks (AlexNet, the VGG net, and GoogLeNet) into fully convolutional networks and transfer their learned representations by fine-tuning to the segmentation task. We then define a skip architecture that combines semantic information from a deep, coarse layer with appearance information from a shallow, fine layer to produce accurate and detailed segmentations.

We then review developments from the open literature in various aspects of this truly multidisciplinary field. First, we discuss different transducer technologies, including both piezoelectric and non-conventional popular and non-conventional piezoelectric transducers. Next, we examine guided-wave theory, tracing its early history down to modern developments. Following this, we detail the efforts into models for guided-wave excitation by SHM transducers. Then, we review several signal processing related works. The next topic in Section 6 is guided-wave SHM system development, and we explore various packaging ideas, integrated solutions and efforts to examine robustness to different service conditions.

Experimental results are presented for the application of Lamb wave techniques to quasi-isotropic graphite/epoxy test specimens containing representative damage modes, including delamination, transverse ply cracks and through-holes. Linear wave scans were performed on narrow laminated specimens and sandwich beams with various cores by monitoring the transmitted waves with piezoceramic sensors. Optimal actuator and sensor configurations were devised through experimentation, and various types of driving signal were explored. These experiments provided a procedure capable of easily and accurately determining the time of flight of a Lamb wave pulse between an actuator and sensor. Lamb wave techniques provide more information about damage presence and severity than previously tested methods (frequency response techniques), and provide the possibility of determining damage location due to their local response nature. These methods may prove suitable for structural health monitoring applications since they travel long distances and can be applied with conformable piezoelectric actuators and sensors that require little power.},

To achieve this, full wavefield scans of thin metal plates are used, half from the undamaged state and half from the damaged state. This data is used to train our deep network to predict the damage state of a plate with 99.98{\%} accuracy given signals from just 10 spatial locations on the plate, as compared to that of a support vector machine (SVM), which achieved a 62{\%} accuracy.},

In addition, the scalability of this metamodelling technique has been investigated by training the CNN metamodels with the data from part of the stiffened panel and testing the performance on other sections with similar geometry. Impacts were detected with an accuracy of over 95{\%}. Impact energy levels were also successfully categorized while trained at coupon level and applied to sub-components with greater complexity.

We show that convolutional networks by themselves, trained end-to-end, pixels-to-pixels, improve on the previous best result in semantic segmentation. Our key insight is to build 'fully convolutional' networks that take input of arbitrary size and produce correspondingly-sized output with efficient inference and learning. We define and detail the space of fully convolutional networks, explain their application to spatially dense prediction tasks, and draw connections to prior models. We adapt contemporary classification networks (AlexNet, the VGG net, and GoogLeNet) into fully convolutional networks and transfer their learned representations by fine-tuning to the segmentation task. We then define a skip architecture that combines semantic information from a deep, coarse layer with appearance information from a shallow, fine layer to produce accurate and detailed segmentations. Our fully convolutional networks achieve improved segmentation of PASCAL VOC (30{\%} relative improvement to 67.2{\%} mean IU on 2012), NYUDv2, SIFT Flow, and PASCAL-Context, while inference takes one tenth of a second for a typical image.},

abstract = {Ultrasonic wavefield imaging with a non-contact technology can provide detailed information about the health status of an inspected structure. However, high spatial resolution, often necessary for accurate damage quantification, typically demands a long scanning time. In this work, we investigate a novel methodology to acquire high-resolution wavefields with a reduced number of measurement points to minimize the acquisition time. Such methodology is based on the combination of compressive sensing and convolutional neural networks to recover high spatial frequency information from low-resolution images. A data set was built from 652 wavefield images acquired with a laser Doppler vibrometer describing guided ultrasonic wave propagation in eight different structures, with and without various simulated defects. Out of those 652 images, 326 cases without defect and 326 cases with defect were used as a training database for the convolutional neural network. In addition, 273 wavefield images were used as a testing database to validate the proposed methodology. For quantitative evaluation, two image quality metrics were calculated and compared to those achieved with different recovery methods or by training the convolutional neural network with non-wavefield images data set. The results demonstrate the capability of the technique for enhancing image resolution and quality, as well as similarity to the wavefield acquired on the full high-resolution grid of scan points, while reducing the number of measurement points down to 10{\%} of the number of scan points for a full grid.},

abstract = {Structural health monitoring (SHM) is usually focused on damage detection (e.g., Yes/No) or approximate estimation of damage size. Any additional details of the damage such as configuration, shape, networking, geometrical statistics, etc., are often either ignored or significantly simplified during SHM characterization. These details, however, can be extremely important for understanding of damage severity and estimations of follow-up damage growth risk. To avoid expensive human participation and/or over-conservative SHM decisions, solutions of computational recognition for damage characterization are needed. Autonomous SHM from visual data is one of the significant challenges in the field of structural prognostics and health monitoring (PHM). The main shortcomings of the image-based PHM algorithms arise from the lack of robustness and fidelity to handle the variability of environment and nature of damage types. In recent times, deep learning has drawn huge amount of traction in the field of machine learning and visual pattern recognition due to its superior performance compared to the state-of-the-art techniques. This paper proposes to formulate and apply a deep learning technique to characterize the damage in the form of cracks on a composite material. The deep learning architecture is constructed by multi-layer neural network that is based on the fundamentals of unsupervised representational learning theory. The robustness and the accuracy of the approach is validated on an extensive set of real image data collected via applying variable load conditions on the structure. The paper has shown a high characterization accuracy over a wide range of loading conditions with limited number of labeled training image data.},

abstract = {Delamination, i.e. the separation between layers that occurs by failure of the resin-rich interlaminar interface, is a direct consequence of the lack of out-of-plane reinforcements and, undoubtedly, the most common damage mode in laminated composites. Delaminations induced by low-velocity impacts are of primary concern in structural applications, since impact damage, often miss-detected, may propagate, impairing the load bearing capacity of the component, particularly under compressive loads. Preventing delamination, as well as delaying and limiting its propagation, are thus key issues in the design of composite structures. Over the last decades, many strategies have been proposed to address this problem. Among them, the introduction of through-thickness reinforcements (stitching, pinning and stapling) has proven to be effective in improving the interlaminar properties of composite materials. In particular, recent studies have shown that Z-pinning, which consists in inserting high stiffness pins through the thickness of uncured laminates, may significantly enhance the delamination resistance of laminated components. In this study, conventional and Z-pin reinforced [02/902]s graphite/epoxy laminates were subjected to low-velocity impact and compression after impact (CAI) tests in order to examine the effect of the reinforcements on the impact response and the residual post-impact properties of the laminate. The results show that Z-pinning significantly reduces the extent of delamination induced by impact, while, on the contrary, it appears to only marginally improve the post-impact compressive strength of the laminates.},

abstract = {Damage diagnosis has been a challenging inverse problem in structural health monitoring. The main difficulty is characterizing the unknown relation between the measurements and damage patterns (i.e., damage indicator selection). Such damage indicators would ideally be able to identify the existence, location, and severity of damage. Therefore, this procedure requires complex data processing algorithms and dense sensor arrays, which brings computational intensity with it. To address this limitation, this paper introduces convolutional neural network (CNN), which is one of the major breakthroughs in image recognition, to the damage detection and localization problem. The CNN technique has the ability to discover abstract features and complex classifier boundaries that are able to distinguish various attributes of the problem. In this paper, a CNN topology was designed to classify simulated damaged and healthy cases and localize the damage when it exists. The performance of the proposed technique was evaluated through the finite-element simulations of undamaged and damaged structural connections. Samples were trained by using strain distributions as a consequence of various loads with several different crack scenarios. Completely new damage setups were introduced to the model during the testing process. Based on the findings of the proposed study, the damage diagnosis and localization were achieved with high accuracy, robustness, and computational efficiency.},

To carry out SHM in prac- tice, two different approaches are used, the first is based on modelling which requires to build a very detailed model of the structure, while the second is by means of data-driven approaches which use information collected from the structure under different struc- tural states and perform an analysis by means of data analysis .

Short Time Fourier Transform (STFT) is employed to transform the transient responses into two-dimensional spectral frame representation. A convolutional neural network is incorporated to distinguish between the damaged and undamaged states, as well as various types of damage of the laminated composites, by automatically extracting discriminative features from the vibration-based spectrograms. The CNN showed a classification accuracy of 90.1{\%} on one healthy and 12 delaminated cases. The study of the confusion matrix of CNN provided further insights into the physics of the problem.

@article{Alguri2019,
abstract = {In recent years, the use of scanning laser Doppler vibrometery and full wavefield acquisition has grown to aid the char- acterization of ultrasonic waves and the detection of structural defects. Yet, these methods require a considerable amount of time to acquire full wavefield data. Therefore, there is a significant need to reduce acquisition time. In this preliminary work, we present a transfer learning approach for reducing the number of sampled measurements necessary. Our method utilizes numerical simula- tions, combined with a small number of spatially sampled random measurements from an experimental structure, to reconstruct full wavefield data. Specifically, we use an autoencoder neural network to learn low-dimensional representations of wave propagation from numerical simulations. We then input a few experimental measurements into the neural network to reconstruct full wave- field data. To demonstrate the ability of our framework, we show our initial success in three scenarios. We show reconstruction accuracies of 86{\%} with one-fourth of the total measurements.},

@article{Tibaduiza2018,
abstract = {Inspection strategies with guided wave-based approaches give to structural health monitoring (SHM) applications several advantages, among them, the possibility of the use of real data from the structure which enables continuous monitoring and online damage identification. These kinds of inspection strategies are based on the fact that these waves can propagate over relatively long distances and are able to interact sensitively with and uniquely with different types of defects. The principal goal for SHM is oriented to the development of efficient methodologies to process these data and provide results associated with the different levels of the damage identification process. As a contribution, this work presents a damage detection and classification methodology which includes the use of data collected from a structure under different structural states by means of a piezoelectric sensor network taking advantage of the use of guided waves, hierarchical nonlinear principal component analysis (h-NLPCA), and machine learning. The methodology is evaluated and tested in two structures: (i) a carbon fibre reinforced polymer (CFRP) sandwich structure with some damages on the multilayered composite sandwich structure and (ii) a CFRP composite plate. Damages in the structures were intentionally produced to simulate different damage mechanisms, that is, delamination and cracking of the skin.},
