\subsection{Dataset}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
In this work, we have generated a large dataset of 475 cases of a full wavefield of propagating Lamb waves in a plate made of carbon fibre-reinforced plastic (CFRP).
The time-domain spectral element method was used for simulation of Lamb wave interaction with delamination~\cite{Kudela2020}.
It should be added that despite the utilisation of the parallel code of the spectral element method which was run on the Tesla K20X GPU card, the computation of the dataset took about 3 months.
For each case, single delamination was modelled by using the method of splitting nodes between appropriate spectral elements. 
It was assumed that the composite laminate is made of eight layers of a total thickness of 3.9 mm.
The delamination was modelled between the third and fourth layer (see Fig.~\ref{fig:plate_setup} for details).
It should be noted that Fig.~\ref{fig:plate_setup} shows an exaggerated cross-section through the delamination. 
Zero-volume delamination was assumed in the model. 
Delamination spatial location was selected randomly so that the interaction of guided waves with delamination is different for each case.
It includes cases when delamination is located at the edge of the plate which is the most difficult to identify by signal processing methods.
Additionally, the size of the delamination was randomly simulated by selecting the ellipse minor and major axis from the interval 10--40 mm.
Also, the angle between the delamination major axis and the horizontal axis was randomly selected.

Guided waves were excited at the plate centre by applying equivalent piezoelectric forces.
The excitation signal had a form of sinusoid modulated by Hann window. 
It was assumed that the carrier frequency is 50 kHz and the modulation frequency is 10 kHz.

The output from the top and bottom surfaces of the plate in the form of particle velocities at the nodes of spectral elements were interpolated on the uniform grid of 500\(\times\)500 points by using shape functions of elements (see~\cite{Kudela2020} for more details).
It essentially resembles measurements acquired by SLDV in the transverse direction (perpendicular to the plate surface).
An example of the simulated full wavefield data on the top and bottom surfaces is presented in Fig.~\ref{fig:wavefield}.
It should be noted that stronger wave entrapment at delamination can be observed for the case of the wavefield at the top surface.
It is because the delamination within cross-section is located closer to the top surface.
It makes it easier to detect delamination by processing wavefield at the top surface.
It is better visible if the root mean square (RMS) according to Eq.~(\ref{eq:rms}) is applied to the wavefield.
The result of this operation is presented in Fig.~\ref{fig:rms}.
Based on the image analysis, the shape of the delamination can be easier to discern for the top case.
However, the methodology presented in this paper was applied to the more difficult case i.e. wavefield registered at the bottom surface of the plate.
