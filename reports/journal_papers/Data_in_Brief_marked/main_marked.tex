\begin{abstract}
%%%%
The fourth dataset dedicated to the Open Guided Waves platform \cite{moll_open_2018} presented in this work aims at a carbon fiber
composite plate with an additional omega stringer at constant temperature conditions. 
The dataset provides full ultrasonic guided wavefields. \sout{A chirp signal in the frequency range 20-500 kHz and Hann windowed tone-burst signal with \num{5} cycles and carrier frequencies of 16.5 kHz,50 kHz, 100 kHz, 200 kHz and 300 kHz are used to excite guided waves.} 
{\color{red}Two types of signals were used for guided wave excitation, namely chirp signal and tone-burst signal. The chirp signal had a frequency range of  \num{20}-\SI{500}{\kilo\hertz}. The tone-burst signals had a form of sine modulated by Hann window with 5 cycles and carrier frequencies \SIlist{16.5;50;100;200;300}{\kilo\hertz}.}
The piezoceramic actuator used for this purpose was attached to the center of the stringer side surface of the core plate.
Three scenarios are provided with this setup: (1) wavefield measurements without damage, (2) wavefield measurements with a local stringer debond and (3) wavefield measurements with a large stringer debond.
The defects were caused by impacts performed from the backside of the plate.
As result, the stringer feet debonds locally which was verified with conventional ultrasound measurements.

\section*{Value of the Data}

% [Provide 3-6 bullet points explaining why these data are of value to the scientific community. 
% Bullet points 1-3 must specifically answer the questions next to the bullet point, 
% but do not include the question itself in your answer. You may 
% provide up to three additional bullet points to outline the value of these data. 
% Please keep points brief, with ideally no more than 400 characters for each point.]

\begin{itemize}
\itemsep=0pt
\parsep=0pt
% Your first bullet point must explain why these data are useful or important? 
    \item These data provide a data set for elastic guided wave inspection techniques for carbon fibre reinforced polymers with and without an introduced damage. The data thus overcomes the current limitation by a lack of freely available benchmark measurements.
% Your second bullet point must explain who can benefit from these data?
    \item The development of new guided wave-based techniques and the comparison of existing algorithms require high-quality benchmark measurements. Therefore, all researchers in the field of non-destructive evaluation as well as in the field of guided wave-based monitoring can benefit from these data.
%Your third point bullet must explain how these data might be used/reused for further insights and/or development of experiments.
    \item The data set might be used to evaluate existing signal evaluation techniques, to enable comparisons of evaluation methods and finally to develop new signal evaluation techniques based on elastic guided wave measurements.
%In the next three points you may like to explain how these data could potentially make an impact on society and highlight any other additional value of these data.
    \item Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) and non-destructive evaluation (NDE) aim to assess the integrity of a structure non-destructively. These research areas are therefore rapidly gaining in importance, and not only due to the increasing digitization of society.
    \item As importance of ultrasonic guided waves is also growing rapidly, new signal evaluation techniques need to be developed. The provided data set therefore makes an impact in applications ranging from aerospace and automotive to all areas of lightweight construction.
\end{itemize}

\section{Data Description}
The datasets within this article provide full ultrasonic guided wavefield of a CFRP plate with fully bonded (intact) and partially debonded (impacted) omega stringer measured for various excitation frequencies. The measured datasets \cite{kudela_dataset_2021} are organized as follows:

\begin{itemize} 
\item \textit{OGW\_CFRP\_Stringer\_Wavefield\_Intact}: Baseline wavefield measurements of the intact CFRP plate with the omega stringer
\item \textit{OGW\_CFRP\_Stringer\_Wavefield\_FirstImpact}: Wavefield measurements of the CFRP plate with the omega stringer impacted with \SI{15.3}{\joule} at location [\SI{0.38}{\meter}, \SI{0.33}{\meter}]
\item \textit{OGW\_CFRP\_Stringer\_Wavefield\_SecondImpact}: Wavefield measurements of the CFRP plate with the omega stringer impacted for the second time with \SI{19}{\joule} at location [\SI{0.38}{\meter}, \SI{0.34}{\meter}]
\end{itemize}

Each folder contains a number of h5-files for two excitation types: Hann-windowed burst and chirp. The folder name for the burst excitation describes the excitation frequency and number of cycles, peak-to-peak voltage used to drive the PZT and number of averages per point used to record the wavefield, \textit{e.g.} \textbf{BURST\_16\_5kHz\_5HC\_10Vpp\_x3} reads as \SI{16.5}{\kilo\hertz} centre excitation frequency, \num{5} cycles Hann-windowed burst, \SI{10}{\volt} peak-to-peak and \num{3} averages per point. The folder name for the chirp excitation describes the excitation frequency range and chirp duration, peak-to-peak voltage used to drive the PZT and number of averages per point used to record the wavefield, \textit{e.g.} \textbf{CHIRP\_20-500kHz\_125us\_6Vpp\_x3} reads as \SI{20}{}-\SI{500}{\kilo\hertz} excitation frequency range, \SI{125}{\micro\second} chirp duration, \SI{6}{\volt} peak-to-peak and \num{3} averages per point. 
It should be noted that these descriptions correspond to signals coming from a signal generator which were next amplified 20 times by a high voltage amplifier.

To open a h5-file and to see how the h5-files are organized the following options are available:

\begin{itemize} 
\item HDFView \url{https://support.hdfgroup.org/products/java/hdfview/}
\item HDF Compass \url{https://github.com/HDFGroup/hdf-compass} 
\item a MATLAB command \textit{h5disp}
\end{itemize}

In addition, MATLAB and Python scripts are included which can be used to read out the dataset and to visualise the wavefield. 

\section{Experimental Design, Materials and Methods}

\subsection{Description of composite panel}

The CFRP plate corresponds to the \textit{wave field} plate in \cite{Moll2020}. It was manufactured  with a  dimension of \SI{0.5}{\meter} $\times$ \SI{0.5}{\meter} and a nominal thickness of \SI{2}{\milli\meter}. The
corresponding ply thickness is \SI{0.125}{\milli\meter}. The prepreg  \mbox{M21~/~34\%~/~UD134~/~T700~/~300} from Hexply~\textsuperscript{\textregistered} was used to manufacture the plates with a quasi-isotropic (QI) layup of \mbox{$[45/0/-45/90/-45/0/45/90]_S$}. 
The material properties of a single unidirectional layer were measured based on  standard test procedures~\cite{moll_open_2018}. 
The prepreg \mbox{~M21~/~34\%~/~UD194~/~T700~/~IMA-12K} from Hexply~\textsuperscript{\textregistered} was used to separately manufacture the omega stringer. 
The~stringer was  built also in a quasi-isotropic layup \mbox{$[-45/0/90/45/90/-45]_S$} with the dimensions depicted in \autoref{fig:plate_dimensions}. The~nominal thickness is 1.5\,mm with a ply thickness of \SI{0.125}{\milli\meter}. The material properties of plate and stringer are listed in \autoref{tab:material_plate_stringer}. 
The omega stringer was bonded to the plate by using Loctite Hysol 9466. The adhesive was cured in vacuum at room temperature.

A mobile impactor from ID-Lindner has been used to create Barely Visible Impact Damages (BVID) in the specimen. The mobile impactor generates an impact with a defined energy by shooting a metal projectile by means of compressed air. A hemi-spherical projectile with a radius of \SI{25}{\milli\meter} has been employed in order to create BVID. Two impacts have been carried out. The first was executed with an energy of  \SI{15.3}{\joule} and a speed of \SI{6}{\meter\per\second} on the coordinates x=\SI{0.38}{\meter} and y=\SI{0.33}{\meter} according to \autoref{fig:sldv_area}. During the second impact the projectile had a speed of \SI{6.7}{\meter\per\second} and the impact energy of \SI{19}{\joule}. The second impact was located \SI{10}{\milli\meter} above the first impact position, with the intention of increasing the damage size.
	

\subsection{Ultrasound NDT measurements}

As a reference, non-destructive inspection (NDI) was carried out with the ultrasound equipment USPC 4000 AirTech, from Hillger. \autoref{fig:US_damage} displays the C-Scans made after each impact. The colour coding indicates the time-of-flight of the back-wall echo. As observed in \autoref{fig:US_damage1}, the first impact created a minimal debonding between skin and stringer with dimensions around 12x50mm. After the second impact the debonding grew considerably, affecting both feet of the omega stringer. 
{\color{red}The large extent of the second impact, with damaged areas far from the impact location, can be explained by the mechanical properties of the specimen. The impact induces a bending load in the specimen. Due to the stiffness of the stringer, the bending load generates large shear forces in the bonded joint. The adhesive layer, probably weakened from the first impact, did not withstand the shear forces during the second impact.}
The final damage on the specimen is displayed on \autoref{fig:US_damage2}.

\subsection{Data acquisition using scanning laser Doppler vibrometry}

Guided waves were excited by a piezoelectric disk of diameter \SI{10}{\milli\meter} attached to the back surface of the specimen (the side with omega stringer).
The following excitation signals were applied in consecutive measurements:
\begin{itemize}
\item Hann windowed tone-burst signal with 5 cycles and carrier frequencies (\(f_c\)) \SI{16.5}{\kilo\hertz}, \SI{50}{\kilo\hertz}, \SI{100}{\kilo\hertz}, \SI{200}{\kilo\hertz}, \SI{300}{\kilo\hertz},
\item chirp signal in the frequency range \num{20}-\SI{500}{\kilo\hertz} lasting \SI{200}{\micro\second}.
\end{itemize}
{\color{red}The excitation signals used in this paper are illustrated both in the time and frequency domains in Figures~\ref{fig:exc16_5}-\ref{fig:chirp}}.

The applied peak to peak voltage at the signal generator varied depending on the type of the signal from \SI{4}{\volt} to \SI{11}{\volt}. 
Next, signals were amplified \num{20} times.

The measurements using scanning laser Doppler vibrometer (SLDV) were conducted on the opposite side of the specimen in respect to the piezoelectric transducer and omega stringer (on the flat surface).
The specimen central area excluding border of width about 9 mm was measured in \num{483} $\times$ \num{483} points. 
The specimen with highlighted measurement area is presented in \autoref{fig:sldv_area}.
At every measurement point, \num{1024} time samples were registered for Hann windowed signals and \num{2048} time samples for chirp signals. The sampling frequency for burst excitation measurements was in range of \SI{256}{\kilo\hertz} up to \SI{2.56}{\mega\hertz} chosen from series to be around \num{10} times higher than \(f_c\). The sampling frequency for chirp excitation was \SI{1.28}{\mega\hertz}.

The measurements were taken \num{10} times in every grid point and averaged to improve the signal to noise ratio.
The exception was the case of Hann windowed tone-burst signal of carrier frequency \SI{16.5}{\kilo\hertz} where only \num{3} averages were applied.
The origin of the coordinate system is located in the lower-left corner of the specimen.

It should be noted that the dataset contains raw signals, however, a band-pass filter embedded in the Polytec data acquisition system was used during measurements.
The band-pass cut off frequencies were \(f_{cut1} = \num{0.5}f_c \) and \(f_{cut2} = \num{1.5}f_c \).

\subsection{Wavefield animation}
{\color{red}Full wavefields of guided waves measured by the scanning laser Doppler vibrometer are of great importance in the field of SHM and NDE. They can be used for validation of various numerical models~\cite{Shen2016,Kudela2020a} as well as for development of damage identification algorithms \cite{Radzienski2011,ROGGE2013,MESNIL2015,LUGOVTSOVA2021,Staszewski2012}. Hence, our aim is to provide such a dataset so that various methods can be quantitatively compared.}

The dataset is accompanied by Matlab script \verb+Read_AcousticWavefield.m+ as well as Python scripts \verb+readData.py+ and \verb+makeVideo.py+ which can be used for reading and visualising data. The scripts should be copied to the desired sub-folder with \verb+*.h5+ files so that data will be processed in the current path or alternatively scripts can be modified by including full paths.

Exemplary frames of propagating waves for the case of \SI{100}{\kilo\hertz} excitation are presented in \autoref{fig:frames}.
Three cases are presented: (i) intact specimen (\autoref{fig:frame128_intact} and \autoref{fig:frame192_intact}), (ii) specimen after first impact (\autoref{fig:frame128_1st_impact} and \autoref{fig:frame192_1st_impact}) and (iii) specimen after second impact.
It can be noted that slight differences in the wave pattern caused by the impact appear at \SI{0.15}{\milli\second} in \autoref{fig:frame192_1st_impact}.
In \autoref{fig:frame128_2nd_impact} reflection from the stringer is not present which means that the stringer foot debonded from the plate.

\subsection{Postprocessing}

A simple postprocessing was applied to the acquired full wavefield measurements.
The goal is to show that partial debonding of the stringer from the host plate is a challenging problem.
Simple signal processing method such as weighted root mean square (WRMS)\cite{Radzienski2011} is not able to highlight the defected area. Only slight changes in the energy distribution are visible as it is presented in \autoref{fig:WRMS}.
Therefore, more advanced signal processing algorithms must be developed and the provided dataset can serve as a benchmark.
On the other hand, after second impact, stringer has partially debonded from the plate. Based on WRMS image in \autoref{fig:WRMS_2nd_impact} it can be concluded that the debonding is extensive - only upper right part of the foot of the stringer remains in contact with the plate.

Another post-processing technique used in this work is a local wavenumber mapping technique introduced by Rogge and Leckey \cite{ROGGE2013} in combination with the one-frequency-approach of Mesnil~\textit{et~al.}~\cite{MESNIL2015}. Wavenumber mapping allows to identify discontinuties in wavenumbers which are caused by local changes in thickness. For instance, a wave travelling in a pristine composite plate will have a different wavenumber than that of a delaminated region. The wavenumber in the damaged region will be equal to that of the plate portion above/below the delamination, when measurement are done on top/bottom. 

The necessary steps along with the source code to calculate the wavenumber maps can be found in~\cite{LUGOVTSOVA2021}. The A0-like mode only was used for the analysis due to its sensitivity to the thickness variation. All other modes were filtered out by applying a radial filter in the wavenumber domain leaving the wavenumbers between \SI{350}{\radian\per\meter} and \SI{750}{\radian\per\meter} only. The point-wise window size of 31 x 31 bins was applied which corresponds to \SI{31}{\milli\meter} and fulfills the wavenumber resolution criteria of the window size being at least two wavelengths of the expected modes \cite{ROGGE2013}. Moreover, the wavenumber maps were filtered using a median filter of 11 x 11 bins to reduce the influence of the measurement noise and artefacts. Calculations were done in MATLAB on a 64-bit Windows 10 PC with 32~GB RAM for a wavefield data set which was zero-padded in space to the size of 512 × 512 x 1024. The computational time for one wavenumber map was about \SI{18}{\minute}.

\end{figure}

First of all, the transducer is visible in every wavenumber map in the middle of sample having the wavenumber of \SI{520}{\radian\per\meter}. A typical edge artifact can be observed too. The feet of the stringer are highlighted at positions around $y=\SI{0.33}{\meter}$ and $y=\SI{0.42}{\meter}$ with the wavenumber of $\approx$~\SI{500}{\radian\per\meter}. Note that the wavenumber for the upper foot are not homogeneous through its length which may indicate the lack of bonding at the discontinuities, \textit{e.g.} see a region at $y=\SI{0.42}{\meter}$ and $x=\SI{0.18}{}-\SI{0.24}{\meter}$ in~\autoref{fig:LW_intact} and \ref{fig:LW_1st_impact}. These discontinuities are also partially visible in WRMS maps shown in~\autoref{fig:WRMS_intact} and \ref{fig:WRMS_1st_impact}. Moreover, the anisotropy of the composite plate becomes apparent in the wavenumber maps, especially for the case of the second impact shown in~\autoref{fig:LW_2nd_impact}. The left upper as well as the right bottom quadrants of the map have wavenumbers around \SI{610}{\radian\per\meter}, whereas the left bottom and right upper quadrants have wavenumbers around \SI{560}{\radian\per\meter}.    

As for the impact damage, the first impact caused only a small delamination in the structure which is hardly recognisable in the wavenumber map, confer Fig.~\autoref{fig:LW_intact} and \ref{fig:LW_1st_impact}. A black dot in~\autoref{fig:LW_1st_impact} marks the impact position. The change in the wavenumber between intact structure and the structure after the first impact varies between \SI{5}{\radian\per\meter} and \SI{29}{\radian\per\meter}, measured to the right of the impact location at positions $y=\SI{0.33}{\meter}$ and $x=\SI{0.415}{\meter}$, and $y=\SI{0.33}{\meter}$ and $x=\SI{0.418}{\meter}$, respectively. This damage would probably go unnoticed, if one would not know where to look at. The WRMS map shown in~\autoref{fig:WRMS_1st_impact} gives a better indication of the damage thanks to the scattering of the waves at the delamination.
For the case of the second impact, both WRMS (\autoref{fig:WRMS_2nd_impact}) and wavenumber (\autoref{fig:LW_2nd_impact}) maps indicated the debonding of the whole bottom foot and the left half of the upper foot. All in all, for the case presented here, the only difference of wavenumber mapping over WRMS is additional information provided about the plate's anisotropy.
