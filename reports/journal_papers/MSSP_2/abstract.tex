%A novel full wavefield processing method by using fully convolutional neural networks is presented.
%The full wavefield of propagating Lamb waves in the fibre-reinforced composite plate was simulated by the parallel spectral element method.
%It resembles a full wavefield measurements acquired on a surface of the plate by the scanning laser Doppler vibrometer.
%The aim of the proposed technique is an identification of delamination location, size and shape.
%It is achieved by pixel-wise image segmentation by using the end-to-end approach.
%It is possible because of the large dataset of Lamb wave propagation patterns resulting from interaction with delaminations of random location, size and shape.
%It is demonstrated that the proposed method, tested on numerical data, is performing better than conventional adaptive wavenumber filtering method which was developed in previous work.
%Moreover, it enables better automation of delamination identification so that the damage map can be created without user intervention.
%The method was also tested on experimental data acquired on the surface of the specimen in which delamination was artificially created by a Teflon insert.
%The obtained results are promising.
