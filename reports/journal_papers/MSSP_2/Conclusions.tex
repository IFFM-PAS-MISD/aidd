In this paper, we extend our previous work~\cite{Ijjeh2021} regarding delamination detection in composite materials using DL techniques. 
Accordingly, we have trained five different DL models: Res-UNet, VGG16 encoder-decoder, PSPNet, FCN-DenseNet, and GCN for image semantic segmentation.
The models were trained on a numerically generated dataset simulating a full wavefield of propagating guided waves.
DL models show promising results in identifying various types of delaminations regarding their shapes, sizes, and angles. 
Moreover, the models show good generalisation behaviour on predicting the delamination in the unseen numerically generated data.
Additionally, the models show their ability to generalise by detecting the delamination in the experimentally acquired data.
The performance of the models can be further improved if the they are trained on experimental data which allows them to learn new complex patterns.
However, we aim to extend our work on different types of defects in composite materials.
