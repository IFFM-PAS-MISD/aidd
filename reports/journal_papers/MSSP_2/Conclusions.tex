In this paper, we extend our previous work~\cite{Ijjeh2021} regarding delamination identification in composite materials using DL techniques. 
Accordingly, we have trained five different DL models: Res-UNet, VGG16 encoder-decoder, PSPNet, FCN-DenseNet, and GCN for image semantic segmentation.
The models were trained on a numerically generated dataset simulating a full wavefield of propagating guided waves.
DL models show promising results in identifying various types of delaminations regarding their locations, shapes, sizes, and angles. 
Moreover, the models show good generalisation behaviour on predicting the delamination in the unseen numerically generated data.
Additionally, the models show their ability to generalise by detecting the delamination in the experimentally acquired data.
The performance of the models can be further improved if the they are trained on experimental data which allows them to learn new complex patterns.
However, the presented studies are limited to only one type of signal at a carrier frequency of 50 kHz. 
We are planning to create a new dataset for the case of a higher excitation frequency. 
Further, expand the number of experimental scenarios in the future.
