\section{Results and Discussions}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
In this section, four deep learning models  of semantic segmentation approach including U-Net, VGG16 encoder-decoder, FCN-DenseNet and PSPNet were evaluated on three damage scenarios  which were numerically generated in order to identify the delamination.
Additionally, an experimental scenario was also used to evaluate the performance of the models to show the deep learning capabilities of generalization.
For each model, the mean IoU is calculated and presented as a metric of comparison.

In our work, all semantic segmentation models were implemented and trained with Keras API~\cite{chollet2015keras} (an open-source platform) running on top of TensorFlow on a GeForce RTX 2080 GPU from NVIDIA. 
Moreover, for training purposes, we have used K-fold CV technique with \(k=5\), which means each model has trained for \(5\) iterations and finally the mean performance is calculated. 
Further, for each iteration, the models were trained on the augmented dataset up to \(100\) epochs.

The first delamination scenario is shown in fig.~\ref{fig:softmax_448}. 
The RMS of the full wavefield interpolated at the bottom surface of the plate with a delamination located the left edge of the plate and its corresponding ground truth image are shown in fig.~\ref{fig:RMS_flat_shell_Vz_448}, ~\ref{fig:m1_rand_single_delam_448} respectively. 
In fig.~\ref{fig:unet_pred_448} we presents the predicted output of the U-Net model, the IoU = \(0.760\) for this case.
Figure~\ref{fig:vgg16_pred_448} show the predicted output of the VGG16 encoder-decoder model, and the IoU = \(0.841\). 
Figure~\ref{fig:pspnet_pred_448} shows the predicted output of PSPNet model, the IoU =\(0.747\).
The last figure in the first scenario fig.~\ref{fig:fcn_densenet_pred_448}	show the predicted output of FCN-DenseNet model, the IoU=\(0.757\).

Figure.~\ref{fig:Exp_ERMS_teflon}, shows an experimental scenario of CFRP with Teflon insert as artificial delamination.
Similar to the numerically generated cases, we applied a frequency of \(50\) kHz to excite the transducer which we placed at the centre of the plate.
Figures~(\ref{fig:unet_exp_7_} - \ref{fig:fcn_densenet_exp}) shows the predicted outputs of U-Net, VGG16 encoder-decoder, PSPNet and FCN-DenseNet models receptively.
As shown, the models are capable of detecting and identifying the delamination. 
The U-Net model detect the delamination with IoU = \(0.082\), the VGG16 encoder-decoder IoU  = \(0.550\), the PSPNet IoU =\(0.425\), and the FCN-DenseNet IoU =\(0.250\).
We can see that the models can identify the delamination despite predicted noise, this indicates that the models are capable to generalise and detect the delamination on previously unseen data. 
Since our models were only trained on the numerically generated data we expect the models will show great generalisation capability, and their performance can be improved when training on experimental data besides the numerical data.

In table~\ref{tab:table_iou}, we presents the maximum and the mean value of IoU for the U-Net, VGG16 encoder-decoder, PSPNet and FCN-DenseNet models.
As shown from the table~\ref{tab:table_iou}, all models have a relatively high IoU, which means their ability to detect and localise the delamination which is relatively high compared to the traditional techniques as wavenumber filtering which we have already performed in our previous work in which we compared wavenumber filtering with FCN-DenseNet to detect delamination in composite materials.

The total number of parameters in any deep learning model is a sum of the trainable parameters (e.g weights of a convolution filters) and non-trainable parameters (biases and  pooling filters).
Trainable parameters are continuously updated until we reach the minimum loss value while the non-trainable parameters are not changed during the whole training process.
The total number of parameters can reflect the model's complexity, hence, it can be noted that as the total parameters increases the requiring time for training increases.
Table~\ref{tab:table_parameters} shows the total number of parameters for all our implemented models.
%However, the total number of parameters of a model does not reflect its performance, as shown in table~\ref{tab:table_iou} PSPNet model has less parameters than UNet model
