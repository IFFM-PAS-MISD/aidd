\subsection{Dataset}
In this work, our previously generated dataset~\cite{Ijjeh2021} was used for training various DL models.
Further, the generated dataset resembles velocity measurements acquired by SLDV in the transverse direction (perpendicular to the plate surface).
The dataset contains 475 simulated cases of full wavefield of propagating Lamb waves in a plate made of CFRP which is made of eight layers of a total thickness of \(3.9\) mm.
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

The delamination in the model is represented by two shell layers that are connected only at the boundary of the damaged area. 
These elements are computed by considering the corresponding, reduced, number of laminae, and their offset form the neutral axis of the plate. 
This approach, which is detailed in~\cite{Kudela2009}, has the advantage of preserving the computational efficiency of the model in comparison to solid elements, as the increase in nodes is usually modest. 
Additionally, the beneficial property of the mass matrix, which is diagonal, are maintained. 
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
Each simulated case represents the interaction of Lamb waves with a single   delamination which was simulated by considering random factors as spatial location, size, and orientation.
The plate with overlayed 475 delamination cases is shown in Fig.\ref{fig:rand_delaminations}.

Each simulated case in the dataset computed from the wave propagation model is a 3D matrix, which holds the amplitudes of the propagating waves at location \((x,y)\) and time \((t)\).
Hence, these matrices can be seen as animated frames at discrete time \(t_k\) of propagating waves.
Moreover, it should be mentioned that the simulated delaminations were located closer to the top surface of the plate.
Accordingly, it is easier to detect delamination by using the simulated full wavefield on the top surface of the plate instead of the bottom surface.
However, to train our various models we applied the more difficult case in which the full wavefield was registered at the bottom surface of the plate.
To enhance the visualisation, the root mean square depicted in Eq.~(\ref{ref:rms}) was applied for the full wavefield frames.
\begin{equation}
	\hat{s}(x,y) = \sqrt{\frac{1}{N}\sum_{k=1}^{N} s(x,y,t_k)^2}
	\label{ref:rms}
\end{equation}
where \(N\) refers to the number of sampling points (\(N=512\)).
Figures~\ref{fig:rmstop} and \ref{fig:rmsbottom} show the result of applying RMS to the full wavefield from the top and bottom surface of the plate respectively.
The dataset consisting of RMS images which were used in this research paper is available online~\cite{Kudela2020d}.

\subsection{Data preprocessing}
To enhance the performance of the optimizer during the training process, the colour scale values were normalized to a range of (\(0-1\)) instead of the initial scale which was in a range of (\(0 - 255\)).	
Furthermore, we have applied data augmentation to the dataset by flipping the images horizontally, vertically, and diagonally. 
As a result, the dataset size increased four times -- \(1900\)  images were produced.
We have split the dataset into two portions:  \(80\%\) for the training set and \(20\%\) for the testing set.
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
Moreover, a K-folds cross-validation method~\cite{Srinivasan2019} was applied to the training set to reduce the overfitting which happens when the model is able to fit on the training data, while it poorly fit on the new unseen data.
In other words, the model only learns the patterns of the training data therefore the model will not generalise well. 
The main advantage of the K-folds method versus a regular train/test split is to reduce the overfitting by utilising data more efficiently as every data sample is used in both training and validation. 
Therefore, by using this technique, we aim to improve the ability of the model to generalise and reduce overfitting.
