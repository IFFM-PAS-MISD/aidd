%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
In this section, five DL models of semantic segmentation approach including  Res-UNet, VGG16 encoder-decoder, FCN-DenseNet, PSPNet, and GCN were evaluated on exemplary three damage scenarios of an RMS of the numerically calculated full wavefield interpolated at the bottom surface of the plate in order to identify the delamination.
Additionally, an experimental scenario was also used to evaluate the performance of the models to show the DL capabilities of generalization.
For each model, the mean and the max \(IoU\) are calculated and presented as a metric of comparison.
Moreover, the Accuracy of classification, Precision, Recall, and F1 score were calculated for each model.
%\begin{equation}
%	\rm Accuracy\ = \frac{TP+TN}{(Total\ number\ of\ tested\ samples)}
%	\label{accuracy}
%\end{equation}
%
%\begin{equation}
%	\rm Pricision\ =\frac{TP}{TP+FP}
%	\label{pricisoin}
%\end{equation}
%\begin{equation}
%	\rm Recall\ = \frac{TP}{TP+ FN}
%	\label{recall}
%\end{equation}
%\begin{equation}
%	\rm F1 score =\frac{2 \times (Pricision\times Recall)}{(Pricision + Recall)} 
%	\label{f1_score}
%\end{equation}
%where the Positive/Negative refers to the predicted output as (damage or non-damage) respectively, True Positive (TP) and True Negative (TN)  represent the correct classification, and the False Positive (FP) and False Negative (FN) represent the incorrect classification.

In this work, all semantic segmentation models were implemented and trained with Keras API~\cite{chollet2015keras} running on top of TensorFlow.
Further, we have replaced the previous NVIDIA RTX2080 GPU utilised in our work~\cite{Ijjeh2021} with a superior NVIDIA Tesla V100 GPU with \(32\)GB memory that enables us to increase the total number of learnable parameters of the DL models that will allow them to learn and extract more features. 
For training purposes, we have used the K-fold cross-validation technique with five folds. 
Accordingly, each model has trained for \(5\) iterations. 
For each iteration, we calculated the mean accuracy of all folds.
Further, the number of epochs equals \(20\) per iteration.

\subsection{Numerical scenarios}
In the following, three scenarios of numerical data regarding delamination of different locations, shapes, and angles are presented. 
The first exemplary delamination scenario is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:softmax_448}. 
The delamination is located at the left edge of the plate, and it is surrounded by a line to represent its shape and location as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:RMS_flat_shell_Vz_448}.
Figures~\ref{fig:unet_pred_448}-~\ref{fig:gcn_pred_448} show the predicted output of the Res-UNet, VGG16 encoder-decoder, PSPNet, FCN-DenseNet and GCN models, respectively. 
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
All models properly indicate the location of the delamination. 
Moreover, pixels related to delamination location are clustered into a single spot without any additional noise. 
VGG16 encoder-decoder and GCN models better visually resemble the actual shape of the delamination than other models.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
In the second delamination scenario, shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:385_softmax}, the delamination is located at the upper left corner of the plate, and it is surrounded by an ellipse to represent its shape and location as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:RMS_flat_shell_Vz_385}.
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
This is the most challenging damage scenario because of reflections coming from plate edges overshadows reflections from damage.
As a result, changes in RMS patterns are barely visible.

All models perform reasonably well, considering the difficult damage scenario.

The third delamination scenario is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:475_softmax}. 
The delamination is located at the upper middle of the plate and it is surrounded by an ellipse to represent its shape and location as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:RMS_flat_shell_Vz_475}.
Figures~\ref{fig:Unet_Pred__softmax_475} -~\ref{fig:gcn_pred_475} show the predicted output of the Res-UNet, VGG16 encoder-decoder, PSPNet, FCN-DenseNet and GCN models, respectively. 
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
In this case, the elliptical shape of delamination is best preserved by Res-UNet and FCN-DenseNet. 
However, the highest value of IoU is obtained by GCN (see Table~\ref{tab:table_numerical_scenarios}).

The \(IoU\) values for all models regarding the predicted delamination are presented in Table.~\ref{tab:table_numerical_scenarios}.
For the first and third scenarios, the GCN model has the highest \(IoU\) compared to the other models, and for the second scenario, the VGG16 encoder-decoder model has the highest \(IoU\) compared to the other models.
Further, in all models, the predicted outputs have no noise regarding delamination identification.

Table~\ref{tab:table_iou} presents the mean and maximum values of \(IoU\) calculated for the previously unseen numerical test set (380 cases) for all models.
Table~\ref{tab:table_iou} shows that all models have a relatively high \(IoU\), indicating their ability to detect and localise the delamination, which is higher compared to the traditional signal processing techniques such as the adaptive wavenumber filtering presented in our previous work~\cite{Ijjeh2021}. 
The mean \(IoU\) for the adaptive wavenumber filtering technique regarding the whole testing samples was \(0.373\) compared to the previous FCN-DenseNet model, which has a mean \(IoU\) of \(0.623\).

Moreover, Table~\ref{tab:evaluation_metric} presents the classification accuracy, precision, recall, and the F1-score values for all models as additional evaluation metrics.
As shown in Table~\ref{tab:evaluation_metric}, all models have high classification accuracy, which indicates that all the presented models are capable of predicting the presence of the delamination in all the numerically generated cases.

Moreover, the total number of parameters in any DL model is a sum of the trainable parameters (weights of convolution filters) and non-trainable parameters (biases and pooling filters).
Trainable parameters are continuously updated until we reach the minimum loss value, while the non-trainable parameters are not changed during the whole training process.
Table~\ref{tab:table_parameters} shows the total number of parameters for all implemented models.
Further, the total number of parameters can reflect the computation complexity of the model.
It can be noted that as the number of total parameters increases, the required time for training increases.

\subsection{Experimental scenario}
In this scenario, an experimental case of CFRP with Teflon insert as artificial delamination is investigated presented in Fig.~\ref{fig:Exp_ERMS_teflon}. 
Similar to the synthetic data set, we applied a frequency of \(50\) kHz to excite a signal in a transducer placed at the centre of the plate. 
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
A0 mode wavelength for this particular CFRP material at such frequency is about 20 mm. 
The measurements were performed by Polytec PSV-400 SLDV on a bottom surface of the plate of dimensions 500 by 500 mm. 
The measurement grid spacing was 1 mm and sampling frequency 512 kHz. 
The measured full wavefield was further processed by an energy compensated RMS takes into account wave attenuation. 
The results of such operation are shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:Delamination}.
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
The delamination is surrounded by a square frame representing its shape and location. 
Figures~(\ref{fig:unet_exp_7_} - \ref{fig:gcn_exp}) shows delamination prediction maps for Res-UNet, VGG16 encoder-decoder, PSPNet, FCN-DenseNet and GCN models, receptively.
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
The performance of the models were evaluated by using IoU metric which takes into account not only damage location but also its shape and size. 
The following results were obtained: the Res-UNet IoU = 0.577, the VGG16 encoder-decoder \(IoU = 0.624\), the
PSPNet \(IoU = 0.488\), the FCN-DenseNet \(IoU = 0.537\) and the GCN \(IoU =
0.723\). 
Similarly to the numerical dataset, the best accuracy was achieved by using GCN.
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
As shown, the models are capable of precise detection and localisation of the delamination. 
We can see that the models can identify the delamination with almost free noise, which indicates the models are capable of generalising and detecting the delamination on previously unseen data. 
Considering the presented models were trained only on the numerically generated dataset, the models show high generalisation capability.
The performance of the models can be further improved when they are trained on the experimental and the numerical data, as new features will be learned.
