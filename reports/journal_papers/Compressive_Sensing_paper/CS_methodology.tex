\subsection{Compressive sensing theory}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

According to the CS theory~\cite{Candes2006}, under specific conditions, a signal $\vec{s}\in \mathbb{R}^n$ can be reconstructed from a linear combination of random measurements $\vec{y} \in \mathbb{R}^m$.
The general under-sampling problem can be written as:
\begin{equation}
	\vec{y} = \bs{\Phi} \vec{s},
\end{equation}
where $\bs{\Phi} \in \mathbb{R}^{m\times n}$ is the downsampling measurement matrix and $m$ is the number of measurements which can be much smaller than the number of samples in the signal ($m<<n$).

The signal $\vec{s}$ can be recovered from the compressed measurements $\vec{y}$, if it has sparse representation in some model basis $\bs{\Psi} \in \mathbb{R}^{n\times n}$, which can be written as:
\begin{equation}
	\vec{s} = \bs{\Psi} \bs{\alpha},
\end{equation}
where $\bs{\alpha}$ has $K$ nonzero elements ($K<m<n$) and signal $\vec{s}$ is called $K$-sparse. 
Moreover, the downsampling measurement matrix $\bs{\Phi}$ has to be incoherent with the model basis $\bs{\Psi}$~\cite{Candes2007}.
In practical applications, signals contain noise, hence:
\begin{equation}
	\vec{y} = \bs{\Phi} \bs{\Psi} \bs{\alpha} + \vec{z},
	\label{eq:cs_with_noise}
\end{equation}
where $\vec{z}$ represents noise.
The recovery problem can be solved by the basis pursuit denoising algorithm by relaxing Eq.~(\ref{eq:cs_with_noise}) and using sparsity promoting $L_1$ norm which can be written as:
\begin{equation}
	\min{\lVert \tilde{\bs{\alpha}} \rVert}_1 \quad \textrm{subject to} \quad {\lVert \bs{\Phi} \bs{\Psi} \tilde{\bs{\alpha}} -\vec{y} \rVert}_2 \leq \sigma ,
\end{equation}
where $\sigma$ is related to the noise level in the data.

In particular, in this paper we employed SPGL1 algorithm~\cite{VandenBerg2019} and Fourier basis.
