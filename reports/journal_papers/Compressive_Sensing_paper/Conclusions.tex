\section{Conclusions}
\label{conclusion}
In this paper, we demonstrate two super-resolution deep learning techniques to reconstruct the HR full wavefield of propagating guided waves.
Accordingly, a large synthetic dataset was generated, resembling the full wavefields acquired by an SLDV.
In DLSR models, the utilised compression rate was \(19.2\%\)\ of the Nyquist sampling rate.
To see the feasibility of such a study, we have compared the DLSR models with the conventional CS technique. 
The results were promising, and the deep learning models surpassed the conventional technique in reconstructing the full wavefield frames, although the CS technique was applied to various compression ratios.
Additionally, DLSR models showed their ability to generalise by reconstructing the full wavefield frames acquired experimentally by SLDV.
Consequently, we can conclude that adopting deep learning techniques for SR frame reconstruction outperforms conventional CS techniques.
Furthermore, deep learning techniques for SR can highly enhance the speed of data acquisition by SLDV.
