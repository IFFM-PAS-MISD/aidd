abstract = {One of the main challenges faced by the structural health monitoring community is acquiring and processing huge sets of acoustic wavefield data collected from sensors, such as scanning laser Doppler vibrometers or ultrasonic scanners. In fact, extracting information that allows the estimation of the damage condition of a structure can be a time-consuming process. This paper presents a damage detection and localization technique based on a compressive sensing algorithm, which significantly allows us to reduce the acquisition time without losing in detection accuracy. The proposed technique exploits the sparsity of the wavefield in different representation domains, such as those spanned by wave atoms, curvelets, and Fourier exponentials to recover the full wavefield and, at the same time, to infer the damage location, based on comparison between the wavefield reconstructions produced by the different representation domains. The procedure is applied to three different setups related to an aluminum plate with a notch, a glass fiber reinforced polymer plate with a notch, and a composite plate with a delamination. The results show that the technique can be applied in a variety of structural components to reduce acquisition time and achieve high performance in defect detection and localization by removing up to 80% of the Nyquist sampling grid.},

abstract = {This research is related to a signal processing of full wavefield data as an effective tool for detection, localization and visualization of a crack growth in thin-walled structures. Full wavefield data of propagating Lamb waves in structures such as plates and shells made out of metallic alloys and composite laminates contain a wealth of information about wave pattern anomalies due to occurrence of a damage. The aim is to demonstrate a method for enhancing damage visualization in structures such that estimation of the length and orientation of the crack can be easily obtained. The proposed signal processing involves application of discrete fast Fourier transform, wavenumber domain filtering and inverse discrete Fourier transform. The method is further enhanced by a technique for compensation of the wave attenuation so that the effects of structural damage have the same influence regardless of the location. The concept is first illustrated on numerically simulated data, and then tested on experimental results. In the experiments, full wavefield measurements are obtained using a scanning laser Doppler vibrometer, which allows the measurement of displacements and/or velocities along three axes over a user-defined grid. In the proposed method only out-of-plane velocities are used. Tests performed on simple aluminum and composite plates with artificially introduced longitudinal cracks confirm the effectiveness of the method and its potential for application to the inspection of a variety of structural components. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Guided waves in plates, known as Lamb waves, are characterized by complex, multimodal, and frequency dispersive wave propagation, which distort signals and make their analysis difficult. Estimating these multimodal and dispersive characteristics from experimental data becomes a difficult, underdetermined inverse problem. To accurately and robustly recover these multimodal and dispersive properties, this paper presents a methodology referred to as sparse wavenumber analysis based on sparse recovery methods. By utilizing a general model for Lamb waves, waves propagating in a plate structure, and robust [script-l]1 optimization strategies, sparse wavenumber analysis accurately recovers the Lamb wave's frequency-wavenumber representation with a limited number of surface mounted transducers. This is demonstrated with both simulated and experimental data in the presence of multipath reflections. With accurate frequency-wavenumber representations, sparse wavenumber synthesis is then used to accurately remove multipath interference in each measurement and predict the responses between arbitrary points on a plate.},

abstract = {In this study, a non-destructive testing approach is investigated for finding damages in fiber reinforced polymers using broadband piezoelectric excitation and scanning laser Doppler vibrometer measurements. An efficient broadband filter in wavenumber-frequency domain is considered, in order to calculate a mode-removed broadband weighted root mean square (WRMS) energy map of the guided waves. Compensation of the frequency-dependent wave attenuation is implemented. Because this energy map relates exclusively to abnormalities in the wave field, it shows high sensitivity to all kinds of internal damages. The proposed damage map construction method is automated, and does not require any a priori information on the inspected part or measurement conditions. Further, it is not limited to application on flat coupon samples, but can be equally applied on complex composite parts. The methods are tested on an academic case of a CFRP plate with flat bottom holes and on an industrial case of a large stiffened CFRP aircraft panel with distributed manufacturing defects. It is shown that the broadband mode-removed WRMS energy map is highly sensitive to various kinds of damages, even if they are small and deep inside the material.},

abstract = {Local wavenumber estimation (LWE) applied to a full wavefield response is a powerful approach for detecting and characterizing defects in a composite structure. However, the narrowband nature of the traditional LWE techniques brings several challenges for application on actual test cases. This study proposes a self-reference broadband version of the LWE technique. The broadband vibrations are injected using low-power piezoelectric actuators (sine sweep signal) or using pulsed laser excitation in the thermoelastic regime. The out-of-plane velocity response of the surface is recorded using an infrared scanning laser Doppler vibrometer. The dispersive Lamb wave behavior, corresponding to the damage-free base material, is identified from the broadband vibrational response. Using the identified dispersion curves (i.e. self-reference approach), a Lamb mode passband filter bank in the wavenumber-frequency domain is constructed. Searching for the maximum bandpower density in function of the assumed material thickness provides a robust estimate of the effective local thickness of the tested component, and as such yields a detection and evaluation of damage. The performance of the self-reference broadband LWE algorithm is demonstrated on aluminum plates with various flat bottom holes, as well as on cross-ply CFRP aircraft components with a stiffener disbond and barely visible impact damage. Compared to the traditional narrowband LWE approaches, the proposed self-reference broadband LWE method allows a higher level of automation, removes the need for a priori knowledge on the material and/or defect properties, and results in an improved characterization of defects.},

abstract = {This paper describes a method to effectively image structural features and defects using local estimates of the wavenumber of propagating guided Lamb waves at a fine grid of spatial sampling points. The guided waves are rapidly excited at each grid point using a scanning Q-switched laser system and sensed by a single fixed ultrasonic transducer. Through reciprocity, this produces a full-wave-field time history of a virtual wave being excited from the transducer. Using frequency-wavenumber processing, localized wavelength estimates are obtained by isolating each wave mode, narrowband filtering to one or more high-energy frequency bands, and identifying the center-wavelength of a sliding wavenumber band-pass filter that maximizes the energy at each grid point. The approach was capable of producing detailed images of hidden wall-thinning in an aluminum plate and a steel pipe section and local impact delamination in a complicated composite component. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

In other words, the relation between impact energy and damage detectability will be shown. A numerical model based on the time domain spectral element method is used for modeling of Lamb wave propagation and interaction with barely visible impact damage in a carbon-epoxy laminate. Numerical studies are followed by experimental research on the same material with an impact damage induced by various energy and also a Teflon insert simulating delamination. Wavenumber adaptive image filtering and signal processing are used for damage visualization and assessment for both numerical and experimental full wavefield data. It is shown that it is possible to visualize and assess the impact damage location, size and to some extent severity by using the proposed technique.},

abstract = {Ultrasonic wavefield imaging with a non-contact technology can provide detailed information about the health status of an inspected structure. However, high spatial resolution, often necessary for accurate damage quantification, typically demands a long scanning time. In this work, we investigate a novel methodology to acquire high-resolution wavefields with a reduced number of measurement points to minimize the acquisition time. Such methodology is based on the combination of compressive sensing and convolutional neural networks to recover high spatial frequency information from low-resolution images. A data set was built from 652 wavefield images acquired with a laser Doppler vibrometer describing guided ultrasonic wave propagation in eight different structures, with and without various simulated defects. Out of those 652 images, 326 cases without defect and 326 cases with defect were used as a training database for the convolutional neural network. In addition, 273 wavefield images were used as a testing database to validate the proposed methodology. For quantitative evaluation, two image quality metrics were calculated and compared to those achieved with different recovery methods or by training the convolutional neural network with non-wavefield images data set. The results demonstrate the capability of the technique for enhancing image resolution and quality, as well as similarity to the wavefield acquired on the full high-resolution grid of scan points, while reducing the number of measurement points down to 10% of the number of scan points for a full grid.},
