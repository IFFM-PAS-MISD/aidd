abstract = {The paper presents a Compressed Sensing technique for the reconstruction of guided wavefields. Structural inspections based on the analysis of guided wavefields have proven to be effective at detecting and characterizing damage. However, wavefield detection is often a time consuming process, which limits practicality. The proposed reconstruction technique estimates the location of sources and structural features interacting with the waves from a set of sparse measurements. Such features include damage, described as a scattering source. The wavefield is reconstructed by employing information on the dispersion properties of the medium under consideration. The procedure is illustrated through a one-dimensional analytical example, and subsequently applied to the reconstruction of an experimental wavefield in a composite panel with an artificial delamination. The results confirm the ability of the technique to identify the defect, while reconstructing the wavefield with good accuracy using a significantly reduced number of measurements.},

In this work, we have developed a general approach for low rate sampling and efficient CS impulse response recovery algorithms that exploits convolution signal models of dispersive ultrasonic guided waves with a sparse representation in the frequency warped basis. We apply our framework to both to lower the sampling frequency and to enhance defect localization performances of Lamb wave inspection systems. The reconstruction algorithm is based on both the iterative support estimation and alternating minimization algorithm to further improve localization accuracy, separating the contribution of the exciting wave.

The informative content which can be extracted from these inspections is relevant; however, the acquisition process is generally timeconsuming, posing a limit in the applicability of such approaches. To reduce the acquisition time, we use a random sampling scheme based on compressive sensing (CS) to minimize the number of points at which the field is measured. The CS reconstruction performance is mostly influenced by the choice of a proper decomposition basis to exploit the sparsity of the acquired signal. Here, different bases have been tested to recover the guided waves wave field acquired on both an aluminum and a composite plate.

The sparsity of the signal in the considered representation is exploited to develop data compression strategy based on the Best-Basis Compressive sensing (CS) theory. The proposed data compression strategy has been compared with the transform encoder based on the Embedded Zerotree (EZT), a well known data compression algorithm. These approaches are tested on experimental Lamb wave signals obtained by acquiring acoustic emissions in a 1m2 aluminum plate with conventional piezoelectric sensors. The performances of the two methods are analyzed by varying the compression ratio in the range 40-80%, and measuring the discrepancy between the original and the reconstructed signal.

abstract = {Corrosion damage of aircraft structures can significantly reduce the structural performance and endanger flight safety. There is a pressing need for research on aircraft structural corrosion monitoring technology. Lamb wave tomography (LWT) can be used to evaluate structural corrosion. However, the conventional tomographic method needs sensors with dense array, which is not easy to be satisfied in practice and limits its application. Due to the sparsity of corrosion damage in aircraft structures, compressed sensing (CS), which is an emerging signal processing technique, can be employed to optimize LWT. This paper presents a novel CS-based tomographic method to map out the internal situation of aircraft structure. Compared to conventional LWT, the CS-based tomographic method requires fewer sensors to detect the same corrosion damage while the imaging quality still maintains. The experimental study is carried out to diagnose the real corrosion damage by the new approach. Results show the advantages of the proposed CS-based tomographic method.},

Estimating these multimodal and dispersive characteristics from experimental data becomes a difficult, underdetermined inverse problem. To accurately and robustly recover these multimodal and dispersive properties, this paper presents a methodology referred to as sparse wavenumber analysis based on sparse recovery methods. By utilizing a general model for Lamb waves, waves propagating in a plate structure, and robust [script-l]1 optimization strategies, sparse wavenumber analysis accurately recovers the Lamb wave's frequency-wavenumber representation with a limited number of surface mounted transducers. This is demonstrated with both simulated and experimental data in the presence of multipath reflections. With accurate frequency-wavenumber representations, sparse wavenumber synthesis is then used to accurately remove multipath interference in each measurement and predict the responses between arbitrary points on a plate.},

This paper presents a damage detection and localization technique based on a compressive sensing algorithm, which significantly allows us to reduce the acquisition time without losing in detection accuracy. The proposed technique exploits the sparsity of the wavefield in different representation domains, such as those spanned by wave atoms, curvelets, and Fourier exponentials to recover the full wavefield and, at the same time, to infer the damage location, based on comparison between the wavefield reconstructions produced by the different representation domains. The procedure is applied to three different setups related to an aluminum plate with a notch, a glass fiber reinforced polymer plate with a notch, and a composite plate with a delamination.

However, high spatial resolution, often necessary for accurate damage quantification, typically demands a long scanning time. In this work, we investigate a novel methodology to acquire high-resolution wavefields with a reduced number of measurement points to minimize the acquisition time. Such methodology is based on the combination of compressive sensing and convolutional neural networks to recover high spatial frequency information from low-resolution images. A data set was built from 652 wavefield images acquired with a laser Doppler vibrometer describing guided ultrasonic wave propagation in eight different structures, with and without various simulated defects. Out of those 652 images, 326 cases without defect and 326 cases with defect were used as a training database for the convolutional neural network. In addition, 273 wavefield images were used as a testing database to validate the proposed methodology. For quantitative evaluation, two image quality metrics were calculated and compared to those achieved with different recovery methods or by training the convolutional neural network with non-wavefield images data set. The results demonstrate the capability of the technique for enhancing image resolution and quality, as well as similarity to the wavefield acquired on the full high-resolution grid of scan points, while reducing the number of measurement points down to 10% of the number of scan points for a full grid.},

These limitations include slow data acquisition and a lack of statistical reliability. Our approach addresses both of these challenges. We use sparse wavenumber analysis, sparse wavenumber synthesis, and data-fitting optimization to accurately model damage-free wavefield data. We then combine this model with matched field processing to image damage from a small number of partial wavefield measurements. We further derive a hypothesis test based on extreme value theory to statistically detect damage. We test our framework with Lamb wave measurements from a steel plate. With 70 experimental wavefield measurements, we achieve an empirical probability of damage detection of more than 98%, an empirical probability of false alarm of less than 0.17%, and an accurate image of the damage.},

abstract = {Local wavenumber estimation (LWE) applied to a full wavefield response is a powerful approach for detecting and characterizing defects in a composite structure. However, the narrowband nature of the traditional LWE techniques brings several challenges for application on actual test cases. This study proposes a self-reference broadband version of the LWE technique. The broadband vibrations are injected using low-power piezoelectric actuators (sine sweep signal) or using pulsed laser excitation in the thermoelastic regime. The out-of-plane velocity response of the surface is recorded using an infrared scanning laser Doppler vibrometer. The dispersive Lamb wave behavior, corresponding to the damage-free base material, is identified from the broadband vibrational response. Using the identified dispersion curves (i.e. self-reference approach), a Lamb mode passband filter bank in the wavenumber-frequency domain is constructed. Searching for the maximum bandpower density in function of the assumed material thickness provides a robust estimate of the effective local thickness of the tested component, and as such yields a detection and evaluation of damage. The performance of the self-reference broadband LWE algorithm is demonstrated on aluminum plates with various flat bottom holes, as well as on cross-ply CFRP aircraft components with a stiffener disbond and barely visible impact damage. Compared to the traditional narrowband LWE approaches, the proposed self-reference broadband LWE method allows a higher level of automation, removes the need for a priori knowledge on the material and/or defect properties, and results in an improved characterization of defects.},

abstract = {Laser ultrasonic scanning is attractive for damage detection due to its noncontact nature, sensitivity to local damage, and high spatial resolution. However, its practicality is limited because scanning at a high spatial resolution demands a prohibitively long scanning time. Recently, compressed sensing (CS) and super-resolution (SR) are gaining popularity in the image recovery field. CS estimates unmeasured ultrasonic responses from measured responses, and SR recovers high spatial frequency information from low resolution images. Inspired by these techniques, a laser ultrasonic wavefield reconstruction technique is developed to localize and visualize damage with a reduced number of ultrasonic measurements. First, a low spatial resolution ultrasonic wavefield image for a given inspection region is reconstructed from reduced number of ultrasonic measurements using CS. Here, the ultrasonic waves are generated using a pulsed laser, and measured at a fixed sensing point using a laser Doppler vibrometer (LDV). Then, a high spatial resolution ultrasonic wave image is recovered from the reconstructed low spatial resolution image using SR. The number of measurement points required for ultrasonic wavefield imaging is significantly reduced over 90%. The performance of the proposed technique is validated by an experiment performed on a cracked aluminum plate.},

The aim is to demonstrate a method for enhancing damage visualization in structures such that estimation of the length and orientation of the crack can be easily obtained. The proposed signal processing involves application of discrete fast Fourier transform, wavenumber domain filtering and inverse discrete Fourier transform. The method is further enhanced by a technique for compensation of the wave attenuation so that the effects of structural damage have the same influence regardless of the location. The concept is first illustrated on numerically simulated data, and then tested on experimental results. In the experiments, full wavefield measurements are obtained using a scanning laser Doppler vibrometer, which allows the measurement of displacements and/or velocities along three axes over a user-defined grid.

Compensation of the frequency-dependent wave attenuation is implemented. Because this energy map relates exclusively to abnormalities in the wave field, it shows high sensitivity to all kinds of internal damages. The proposed damage map construction method is automated, and does not require any a priori information on the inspected part or measurement conditions. Further, it is not limited to application on flat coupon samples, but can be equally applied on complex composite parts.

We prove that this curve is convex and continuously differentiable over all points of interest, and show that it gives an explicit relationship to two other optimization problems closely related to BPDN. We describe a root-finding algorithm for finding arbitrary points on this curve; the algorithm is suitable for problems that are large scale and for those that are in the complex domain.

abstract = {The sparsity which is implicit in MR images is exploited to significantly undersample k-space. Some MR images such as angiograms are already sparse in the pixel representation; other, more complicated images have a sparse representation in some transform domain-for example, in terms of spatial finite-differences or their wavelet coefficients. According to the recently developed mathematical theory of compressed-sensing, images with a sparse representation can be recovered from randomly undersampled k-space data, provided an appropriate nonlinear recovery scheme is used. Intuitively, artifacts due to random undersampling add as noise-like interference. In the sparse transform domain the significant coefficients stand out above the interference. A nonlinear thresholding scheme can recover the sparse coefficients, effectively recovering the image itself. In this article, practical incoherent undersampling schemes are developed and analyzed by means of their aliasing interference. Incoherence is introduced by pseudo-random variable-density undersampling of phase-encodes. The reconstruction is performed by minimizing the ℓ1 norm of a transformed image, subject to data fidelity constraints. Examples demonstrate improved spatial resolution and accelerated acquisition for multislice fast spin-echo brain imaging and 3D contrast enhanced angiography. {\textcopyright} 2007 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},
