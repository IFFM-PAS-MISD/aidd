\section{Introduction}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
Guided waves, in particular Lamb waves, are often utilised for structural health monitoring (SHM) as well as non-destructive testing (NDT).
For structural health monitoring usually an array of transducers is used for point-wise measurements.
In the case of active guided wave-based SHM, these are usually piezoelectric transducers that can work as actuators and sensors.
It should be noted that round-robin actuator-sensor measurements can be conducted very fast, therefore nearly online monitoring of a structure is possible.

Recently, a lot of research on application of scanning laser Doppler vibrometer (SLDV) for NDT is reported~\cite{Flynn2013,Kudela2015,Kudela2018d,Segers2021,Segers2022}. 
In this method, either piezoelectric transducer or pulse laser is used for guided wave excitation while the measurements by SLDV are taken at one point on the surface of an inspected structure.
The process is repeated for other points automatically in scanning fashion until full wavefield of Lamb waves is acquired.

Full wavefield measurements are taken on a very dense grid of points opposite to sparsely measured signals by sensors.
Hence, deliver much more useful data from which information about damage can be extracted in comparison to signals measured by an array of transducers.
On the other hand, SLDV measurements take much more time than measurements conducted by an array of transducers.
It makes the SLDV approach unsuitable for SHM in which continuous monitoring is required.
But it is very capable for offline NDT applications.

One can imagine that in a future matrix of laser heads instead of a single laser head used nowadays will be developed to reduce SLDV measurement time.
Alternatively, compressive sensing (CS) and/or deep learning super-resolution (DLSR) can be applied.
It means that SLDV measurements can be taken on a low-resolution grid of points and then full wavefield can be reconstructed at high resolution.

CS was originally proposed in the field of statistics~\cite{Candes2006,Donoho2006} and used for efficient acquisition and reconstruction of signals and images.
It assumes that a signal or an image can be represented in a sparse form in another domain with appropriate bases (Fourier, cosine, wavelet).
In such a bases many coefficients are close or equal to zero.
The sparsity can be exploited to recover a signal or image from fewer samples than required by the Nyquistâ€“Shannon sampling theorem.
However, there is no unique solution for estimation of unmeasured data.
Therefore, optimisation methods for solving under-determined system of linear equations that promote sparsity are applied~\cite{Chen1998,VanEwoutBerg2008,VandenBerg2019}.
Moreover, a suitable sampling strategy is required.

Since then, CS have found applications in medical imaging~\cite{Lustig2007}, communication systems~\cite{Gao2018}, and seismology~\cite{Herrmann2012}.
It is also considered in the field of guided waves and ultrasonic signal processing~\cite{Harley2013,Mesnil2016,Perelli2012,Perelli2015,DiIanni2015,KeshmiriEsfandabadi2018,Chang2020}

We propose a framework for full wavefield reconstruction of propagating Lamb waves from spatially sparse SLDV measurements of resolution below the Nyquist wavelength $\lambda_N$. 
The Nyquist wavelength is the shortest spatial wavelength that can be accurately recovered from wavefield by sequential observations with spacing $\Delta x$ which is defined as $\lambda_N = 2 \Delta x$. 

For the first time, an end-to-end approach is used in which deep learning neural network is trained on a synthetic dataset and tested on experimental data acquired by using SLDV.
It means that the approach is solely based on DLSR.
It is different than methods presented in the literature which utilize CS theory~\cite{Harley2013,KeshmiriEsfandabadi2018} or CS theory in conjunction with super-resolution convolutional neural networks for wavefield image enhancement~\cite{Park2017a,KeshmiriEsfandabadi2020}.
The efficacy of the developed framework is presented and compared with conventional CS approach.  
The performance of the proposed technique is validated by an experiment performed on a plate made of carbon fibre reinforced polymer (CFRP) with embedded Teflon inserts simulating delaminations.
