\subsubsection{Model II:}
In this model, we applied a simple approach of convolutional neural 
networks.
The model is composed of a total of 16 cascaded convolutional layers, in which 
the first layer has a kernel of size \((5\times 5)\), whereas all of the 
remaining layers have a kernel size of \((3\times 3)\).
Accordingly, a ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit) activation function is applied 
after each convolution operation. 
For the final output of the model, the UPNet as of Model-I with sub-pixel 
convolution operation is applied.
As the input low-resolution data here is also \((32\times 32)\), therefore an 
up-scaling factor equal to 16 is applied in order to acquire the HR output 
image of size \((512\times 512)\).
The architecture of this model is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:Model_II}
