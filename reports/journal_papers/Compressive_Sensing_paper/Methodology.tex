\section{Methodology}
\subsection{Dataset preprocessing}
Synthetic dataset~\cite{kudela_pawel_2021_5414555}\\
1. Calculating the Nyquist rate 2d frame. \\
2. Calculating the compression ratio which will be used when generating the low resolution training set based on the previous step. \\
3. Creating two meshes (random and uniform) for generating low resolution frames for training deep learning models.\\
