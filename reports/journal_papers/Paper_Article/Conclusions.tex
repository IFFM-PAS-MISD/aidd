In this paper, we addressed delamination detection in composite materials using a deep learning technique. 
For this purpose, we have trained an FCN-DenseNet for semantic segmentation on a numerically generated data to simulate a full wavefield elastic wave propagation.
To see the feasibility of such a study, we have compared the deep learning model with adaptive wavenumber filtering technique.
The results were promising, and the deep learning model surpasses the conventional technique in detecting the delaminations of different shapes, sizes and angles. 
Further, the model can be improved by training it on new experimental data, that means new patterns will be learned, hence it will enhance its ability to differentiate among different complex patterns.
Currently, our work focuses on delamination identification, however, our work can be extended to the identification of different types of damage in composite materials.
Moreover, we are in the progress of implementing several deep learning architectures to perform a comparative study of different deep learning models regarding delamination identification in composite materials.
