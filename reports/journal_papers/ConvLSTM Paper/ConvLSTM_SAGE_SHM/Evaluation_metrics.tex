\subsection{Evaluation metrics}
For evaluating the performance of the proposed models, the mean intersection over union \(IoU\) was applied as the accuracy metric as depicted in Eq.~\ref{eqn:iou}. 
\begin{equation}
	IoU=\frac{Intersection}{Union}=\frac{\hat{Y} \cap Y}{\hat{Y} \cup Y}
	\label{eqn:iou}
\end{equation}
where \(\hat{Y}\) is the predicted output, and \(Y\) is the ground truth.

A regularization technique, Early stopping was employed for stopping the training once the value of mean \(IoU\) on the validation dataset was not increasing anymore and the model with the best mean \(IoU\) value on validation data was saved for further use on the test and experimental data.
%The model was saved at Epoch = 196, at which the mean IoU values were noted as 0.91, 0.89 on train and validation datasets respectively.
