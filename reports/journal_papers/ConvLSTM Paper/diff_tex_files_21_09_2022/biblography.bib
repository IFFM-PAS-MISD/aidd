abstract = {In this paper an application of Artificial Neural Networks and Probability Ellipse methods for damage detection using Lamb waves is presented. The wave propagation data are used to determine the location and degree of damage in metallic and composite plates. The structural components are to be instrumented with array of actuators and sensors (PCB) able to excite and record its dynamic response. A damage index, calculated from the measured wave propagation data in a reference state (baseline) and the current state, is introduced as a determinant of structural damage. The index is a relative measure comparing the two states of the structure under the same ambient conditions. The damage index increase its intensity when the damage size increase too. Moreover, its calculation in different paths associated with the Artificial Neural Networks or Probability Ellipse methods allow to identify position and entity of the damage. Two panels made by aluminum and fabric composite material have been used for tests. A damage entities simulated as through-thickness hole with diameter equal to 6. mm has been investigated for aluminium panel while three damage entities (through-thickness hole with size equal to 2.5. mm, 4.5. mm and 9. mm) have been investigated for that in composite material. In order to get a training, needful for the application of the ANN method, finite elements analysis have been performed for the aluminum panel taking into account several damage paths. Simulations have been performed in order to characterize the propagation path of the Lamb waves in composite plate changing the damage entities from hole diameter equal to 2.5. mm up to 9. mm. Damage index for each damage size for both simulations and tests will be compared. The potential applications of these methods in developing health monitoring systems in defects-critical structures and in composite material structures are discussed.},

@article{Jia2016a,
abstract = {Aiming to promptly process the massive fault data and automatically provide accurate diagnosis results, numerous studies have been conducted on intelligent fault diagnosis of rotating machinery. Among these studies, the methods based on artificial neural networks (ANNs) are commonly used, which employ signal processing techniques for extracting features and further input the features to ANNs for classifying faults. Though these methods did work in intelligent fault diagnosis of rotating machinery, they still have two deficiencies. (1) The features are manually extracted depending on much prior knowledge about signal processing techniques and diagnostic expertise. In addition, these manual features are extracted according to a specific diagnosis issue and probably unsuitable for other issues. (2) The ANNs adopted in these methods have shallow architectures, which limits the capacity of ANNs to learn the complex non-linear relationships in fault diagnosis issues. As a breakthrough in artificial intelligence, deep learning holds the potential to overcome the aforementioned deficiencies. Through deep learning, deep neural networks (DNNs) with deep architectures, instead of shallow ones, could be established to mine the useful information from raw data and approximate complex non-linear functions. Based on DNNs, a novel intelligent method is proposed in this paper to overcome the deficiencies of the aforementioned intelligent diagnosis methods. The effectiveness of the proposed method is validated using datasets from rolling element bearings and planetary gearboxes. These datasets contain massive measured signals involving different health conditions under various operating conditions. The diagnosis results show that the proposed method is able to not only adaptively mine available fault characteristics from the measured signals, but also obtain superior diagnosis accuracy compared with the existing methods.},

@article{feng2019locating,
abstract = {This paper presents two algorithms, both based on the time of flight (ToF) of scattered waves, to locate defect in an anisotropic woven-fabric carbon fiber reinforced polymer (CFRP) plate. The first algorithm uses a probabilistic approach by constructing a probability matrix. Each element of this matrix is associated with a location and represents the probability of existing a defect at the corresponding spatial coordinates of the plate. For the probability matrix method, localization results are influenced by manually chosen parameters and by the anisotropy of the CFRP plate. The second algorithm, based on artificial neural networks (ANNs), enables us to improve the accuracy of locating defects. With this ANN method, the anisotropic feature can be "learned" by the neural network from training data. The ToF of scattered waves obtained from three sensor pairs were used directly as inputs of the neural network. The spatial coordinates of the defect are the ANN outputs. The difficulty of obtaining sufficient experimental data for ANN training was surpassed by using added blocks on the surface of the plate under test to simulate defects. This scheme was validated and proved to be effective by comparing the scattered waves from a delamination and from an added block. Conclusions have been drawn by comparing the two methods. The localization results obtained by the ANN algorithm are proved to be better.},

abstract = {We present an augmented reality system for large scale 3D reconstruction and recognition in outdoor scenes. Unlike existing prior work, which tries to reconstruct scenes using active depth cameras, we use a purely passive stereo setup, allowing for outdoor use and extended sensing range. Our system not only produces a map of the 3D environment in real-time, it also allows the user to draw (or 'paint') with a laser pointer directly onto the reconstruction to segment the model into objects. Given these examples our system then learns to segment other parts of the 3D map during online acquisition. Unlike typical object recognition systems, ours therefore very much places the user 'in the loop' to segment particular objects of interest, rather than learning from predefined databases. The laser pointer additionally helps to 'clean up' the stereo reconstruction and final 3D map, interactively. Using our system, within minutes, a user can capture a full 3D map, segment it into objects of interest, and refine parts of the model during capture. We provide full technical details of our system to aid replication, as well as quantitative evaluation of system components. We demonstrate the possibility of using our system for helping the visually impaired navigate through spaces. Beyond this use, our system can be used for playing large-scale augmented reality games, shared online to augment streetview data, and used for more detailed car and person navigation.},

Because the computer gathers knowledge from experience, there is no need for a human computer operator to formally specify all the knowledge that the computer needs. The hierarchy of concepts allows the computer to learn complicated concepts by building them out of simpler ones; a graph of these hierarchies would be many layers deep. This book introduces a broad range of topics in deep learning. The text offers mathematical and conceptual background, covering relevant concepts in linear algebra, probability theory and information theory, numerical computation, and machine learning. It describes deep learning techniques used by practitioners in industry, including deep feedforward networks, regularization, optimization algorithms, convolutional networks, sequence modeling, and practical methodology; and it surveys such applications as natural language processing, speech recognition, computer vision, online recommendation systems, bioinformatics, and video games. Finally, the book offers research perspectives, covering such theoretical topics as linear factor models, autoencoders, representation learning, structured probabilistic models, Monte Carlo methods, the partition function, approximate inference, and deep generative models. Deep Learning can be used by undergraduate or graduate students planning careers in either industry or research, and by software engineers who want to begin using deep learning in their products or platforms.

To address this, we introduce Cityscapes, a benchmark suite and large-scale dataset to train and test approaches for pixel-level and instance-level semantic labeling. Cityscapes is comprised of a large, diverse set of stereo video sequences recorded in streets from 50 different cities. 5000 of these images have high quality pixel-level annotations; 20000 additional images have coarse annotations to enable methods that leverage large volumes of weakly-labeled data. Crucially, our effort exceeds previous attempts in terms of dataset size, annotation richness, scene variability, and complexity.

Many challenging computer vision tasks, such as detection, localization, recognition, and segmentation of objects in an unconstrained environment, are being efficiently addressed by various types of deep neural networks, such as convolutional neural networks, recurrent networks, adversarial networks, and autoencoders. Although there have been plenty of analytical studies regarding the object detection or recognition domain, many new deep learning techniques have surfaced with respect to image segmentation techniques. This article approaches these various deep learning techniques of image segmentation from an analytical perspective. The main goal of this work is to provide an intuitive understanding of the major techniques that have made a significant contribution to the image segmentation domain. Starting from some of the traditional image segmentation approaches, the article progresses by describing the effect that deep learning has had on the image segmentation domain. Thereafter, most of the major segmentation algorithms have been logically categorized with paragraphs dedicated to their unique contribution. With an ample amount of intuitive explanations, the reader is expected to have an improved ability to visualize the internal dynamics of these processes.},

abstract = {The mechanical behaviour of composite materials differs from that of conventional structural materials owing to their heterogeneous and anisotropic nature. Different types of defects and anomalies get induced in these materials during the fabrication process. Further, during their service life, the components made of composite materials develop different types of damage. The performance and life of such components is governed by the combined effect of all these defects and damage. While porosity, voids, inclusions etc., are some defects those can get induced during the fabrication of composites, matrix cracks, interface debonds, delaminations and fiber breakage are major types of service induced damage which are of concern. During the service life of components made of composites, one type of damage can grow and initiate another type of damage. For example, matrix cracks can gradually grow to the interface and initiate debonds. Interface debonds in a particular plane can lead to delaminations. Consequently, the combined effect of different types of distributed damage causes the failure of the component.A set of non-destructive evaluation (NDE) methods is well established for testing conventional metallic materials. Some of them can also be utilized for composite materials as they are, and in some cases with a little different approach or modification. Ultrasonics, Radiography, Thermography, Fiber Optics, Acoustic Emission Techniques etc., to name a few. Detection, evaluation and characterization of different types of defects and damage encountered in composite materials and structures using different NDE tools is discussed briefly in this paper. {\textcopyright} Indian Institute of Science.},

abstract = {The interaction of individual Lamb waves with a variety of defects simulated by notches has been investigated using finite-element analysis, the results being checked experimentally. Excellent agreement has been obtained between the numerical and experimental results and it has been shown that a two-dimensional (2-D) Fourier transform method that the authors have developed may be used to quantify Lamb wave interactions with defects in both experimental and numerical investigations. The results have shown that the sensitivity of individual Lamb waves to particular notches is dependent on the frequency-thickness product, the mode type (symmetric or antisymmetric), the mode order, and the geometry of the notch. The sensitivity of the Lamb modes a1, ao, and s0 to simulated defects in different frequency-thickness regions has been predicted as a function of the defect depth to plate thickness ratio (h/2d) and the results have indicated that Lamb waves may be used to find notches when the wavelength to notch depth ratio is of the order of 40. It has also been shown that provided the notch width is small compared to the wavelength, the transmission and reflection amplitudes are insensitive to changes in width, so the ratio of the depth of the notch to the plate thickness is the controlling parameter. Both the numerical and experimental results have shown that the transmission ratios of Lamb waves across defects are highly frequency dependent, particularly at higher frequency-thicknesses. The positions of the maxima and minima in the transmission curves are a function of notch depth that suggests that monitoring the change in transmission ratio with frequency may provide a means of defect sizing. {\textcopyright} 1992 IEEE},

Meanwhile, deep learning provides useful tools for processing and analyzing these big machinery data. The main purpose of this paper is to review and summarize the emerging research work of deep learning on machine health monitoring. After the brief introduction of deep learning techniques, the applications of deep learning in machine health monitoring systems are reviewed mainly from the following aspects: Auto-encoder (AE) and its variants, Restricted Boltzmann Machines and its variants including Deep Belief Network (DBN) and Deep Boltzmann Machines (DBM), Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN). In addition, an experimental study on the performances of these approaches has been conducted, in which the data and code have been online.

abstract = {Deep learning has already been proved as a powerful state-of-the-art technique for many image understanding tasks in computer vision and other applications including remote sensing (RS) image analysis. Unmanned aircraft systems (UASs) offer a viable and economical alternative to a conventional sensor and platform for acquiring high spatial and high temporal resolution data with high operational flexibility. Coastal wetlands are among some of the most challenging and complex ecosystems for land cover prediction and mapping tasks because land cover targets often show high intra-class and low inter-class variances. In recent years, several deep convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures have been proposed for pixel-wise image labeling, commonly called semantic image segmentation. In this paper, some of the more recent deep CNN architectures proposed for semantic image segmentation are reviewed, and each model's training efficiency and classification performance are evaluated by training it on a limited labeled image set. Training samples are provided using the hyper-spatial resolution UAS imagery over a wetland area and the required ground truth images are prepared by manual image labeling. Experimental results demonstrate that deep CNNs have a great potential for accurate land cover prediction task using UAS hyper-spatial resolution images. Some simple deep learning architectures perform comparable or even better than complex and very deep architectures with remarkably fewer training epochs. This performance is especially valuable when limited training samples are available, which is a common case in most RS applications.},

abstract = {Delamination in composite structures plays a major role in lowering structural strength and stiffness, consequently downgrading system integrity and reliability. A Lamb wave-based quantitative identification technique for delamination in CF/EP composite structures was established. Propagation of Lamb waves in a series of composite laminates, individually bearing a delamination, was evaluated using dynamic FEM analyses. Taking advantage of wavelet transform and artificial neural algorithms, an Intelligent Signal Processing and Pattern Recognition (ISPPR) package was developed, by which the spectrographic characteristics of simulated Lamb wave signals in the time-frequency domain were extracted and digitised as Digital Damage Fingerprints (DDF), to construct a Damage Parameters Database (DPD). The DPD was then used offline to train a multi-layer feedforward artificial neural network (ANN) under supervision of an error-backpropagation (BP) algorithm. Assisted by an active online structural health monitoring (AO-SHM) system with an active piezoelectric actuator/sensor network, the proposed methodology was validated online by identifying actual delaminations in CF/EP (T650/F584) quasi-isotropic composite laminates. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {A fully non-contact laser-based nondestructive inspection (NDI) system is developed to detect and visualize damage in structures. The study focuses on the size quantification and characterization of a barely visible impact damage (BVID) in a honeycomb composite panel. The hardware consists of a Q-switched Nd:YAG pulse laser that probes the panel by generating broadband guided waves via thermo-elastic expansion. The laser, in combination with a set of galvano-mirrors is used to raster scan over a two-dimensional surface covering the damaged region of an impacted quasi-isotropic [60/0/−60]s honeycomb composite panel. The out-of-plane velocities are measured at a fixed location normal to the surface by a laser Doppler vibrometer (LDV). An ultrasonic full wavefield assembled from the three-dimensional space-time data matrix in the interrogated area is first acquired and then processed for imaging the impacted damage area. A wavenumber filtering technique in terms of wave vectors is applied to distinguish the forward and backward wavefields in the wavenumber-frequency domain. A zero-lag cross correlation (ZLCC) imaging condition is then employed in the space-frequency domain for damage imaging. The ZLCC imaging condition consists of cross correlating the incident and reflected wavefields in the entire scanned region. The condition not only images the damage boundary between incident and reflected waves outside the damage region but also, for longer time windows, enables to capture the momentary standing waves formed within the damaged region. The ZLCC imaging condition imaged two delaminated region: a main delamination, which was a skewed elliptic with major and minor axis lengths roughly 17 mm and 10 mm respectively, and a secondary delamination region approximately 6 mm by 4 mm, however, which can only be shown at higher frequency range around 80–95 kHz. To conclude, the ZLCC results were in very good agreement with ultrasonic C-scan and X-ray computed tomographic (X-ray CT) scan results. Since the imaging condition is performed in the space-frequency domain, the imaging from ZLCC can also reveal resonance modes which are shown in the main delaminated area by windowing a narrow frequency band sequentially.},

Empirical results demonstrate that Adam works well in practice and compares

However, composite materials are prone to production defects and other defects originated during exploitation, which may jeopardize the safety of such a structure. Thus, non-destructive evaluation methods that are material-independent and suitable for a wide range of defects identification are needed. In this paper, a technique for damage characterization in composite plates is proposed. In the presented non-destructive testing method, guided waves are excited by a piezoelectric transducer, attached to tested specimens, and measured by a scanning laser Doppler vibrometer in a dense grid of points. By means of signal processing, irregularities in wavefield images caused by any material defects are extracted and used for damage characterization. The effectiveness of the proposed technique is validated on four different composite panels: Carbon fiber-reinforced polymer, glass fiber-reinforced polymer, composite reinforced by randomly-oriented short glass fibers and aluminum-honeycomb core sandwich composite. Obtained results confirm its versatility and efficacy in damage characterization in various types of composite plates.},

Hundreds of finite element models have been run to generate natural frequencies up to 10 modes for various combinations of size, shape and location of embedded delamination in a graphite/epoxy plate and then these data have been used to train a back propagation neural network till the network learns to an acceptable level of accuracy. The trained network has been tested to predict the presence of a delamination along with its size, shape and location from the input natural frequencies. An optimum network architecture has been established which can effectively learn the pattern.

The objectives of this article are to present the SPO for SHM problem, to provide an overview of the current state of the art in this area, and to identify promising emergent trends within the literature. The key conclusions drawn are that there remains a great deal of scope for research in a number of key areas, including the development of methods that promote robustness to modelling uncertainty, benign effects within measured data, and failures within the sensor network. There also remains a paucity of studies that demonstrate practical, experimental evaluation of developed SHM system designs. Finally, it is argued that the pursuit of novel or highly efficient optimisation methods may be considered to be of secondary importance in an SPO context, given that the optimisation effort is expended at the design stage.},

abstract = {Learning to store information over extended time intervals by recurrent backpropagation takes a very long time, mostly because of insufficient, decaying error backflow. We briefly review Hochreiter's (1991) analysis of this problem, then address it by introducing a novel, efficient, gradient based method called long short-term memory (LSTM). Truncating the gradient where this does not do harm, LSTM can learn to bridge minimal time lags in excess of 1000 discrete-time steps by enforcing constant error flow through constant error carousels within special units. Multiplicative gate units learn to open and close access to the constant error flow. LSTM is local in space and time; its computational complexity per time step and weight is O. 1. Our experiments with artificial data involve local, distributed, real-valued, and noisy pattern representations. In comparisons with real-time recurrent learning, back propagation through time, recurrent cascade correlation, Elman nets, and neural sequence chunking, LSTM leads to many more successful runs, and learns much faster. LSTM also solves complex, artificial long-time-lag tasks that have never been solved by previous recurrent network algorithms.},

Tests on airbus fuselage panels are conducted to verify the method and damage indeX. The damage indeX relates changes in the energy content of a specific Lamb wave mode selected by group velocity analysis to the eXtent of damage. Second, an imaging method based on multiple pitch-catch information, a network of piezoelectric actuator/sensors, is presented for characterizing damage (location and size) without need for a structural or damage model.

@article{janssens2016convolutional,
abstract = {Vibration analysis is a well-established technique for condition monitoring of rotating machines as the vibration patterns differ depending on the fault or machine condition. Currently, mainly manually-engineered features, such as the ball pass frequencies of the raceway, RMS, kurtosis an crest, are used for automatic fault detection. Unfortunately, engineering and interpreting such features requires a significant level of human expertise. To enable non-experts in vibration analysis to perform condition monitoring, the overhead of feature engineering for specific faults needs to be reduced as much as possible. Therefore, in this article we propose a feature learning model for condition monitoring based on convolutional neural networks. The goal of this approach is to autonomously learn useful features for bearing fault detection from the data itself. Several types of bearing faults such as outer-raceway faults and lubrication degradation are considered, but also healthy bearings and rotor imbalance are included. For each condition, several bearings are tested to ensure generalization of the fault-detection system. Furthermore, the feature-learning based approach is compared to a feature-engineering based approach using the same data to objectively quantify their performance. The results indicate that the feature-learning system, based on convolutional neural networks, significantly outperforms the classical feature-engineering based approach which uses manually engineered features and a random forest classifier. The former achieves an accuracy of 93.61 percent and the latter an accuracy of 87.25 percent.},

However, traditional physics based models do not provide an accurate representation, and classic data driven techniques, such as a support vector machine, are too simplistic to capture the complex nature of ultrasonic guide waves. To address this challenge, this paper uses a deep learning interpretation of ultrasonic guided waves to achieve fast, accurate, and automated structural damaged detection. To achieve this, full wavefield scans of thin metal plates are used, half from the undamaged state and half from the damaged state. This data is used to train our deep network to predict the damage state of a plate with 99.98% accuracy given signals from just 10 spatial locations on the plate, as compared to that of a support vector machine (SVM), which achieved a 62% accuracy.},

@article{sohn2011delamination,
abstract = {This study explores the feasibility of using a non-contact guided wave imaging system to detect hidden delamination in multi-layer composites. The study is conducted in two phases. In the first phase, Lamb waves are excited by a lead (Pb) Zirconate Titanate transducer (PZT) mounted on the surface of a composite plate, and the out-of-plane velocity field is measured using a one-dimensional (1D) scanning laser Doppler vibrometer (LDV). From the scanned time signals, wavefield images are constructed and processed to study the interaction of Lamb waves with delamination. The paper presents additional signal and image processing techniques used to highlight the defect in the scanned area. The techniques are demonstrated using experimental data collected from a 1.8. mm thick multi-layer composite. In the second phase, a completely non-contact system is described to excite and measure guided waves. A modulated continuous wave (CW) laser source in conjunction with a photodiode is used to wirelessly excite an attached PZT and the resulting waves are again sensed using the vibrometer. The non-contact system is used to excite and measure elastic waves in a composite channel test article. The elastic wave propagation image sequences are created from the non-contact excitation system. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Land cover information plays an important role in mapping ecological and environmental changes in Earth's diverse landscapes for ecosystem monitoring. Remote sensing data have been widely used for the study of land cover, enabling efficient mapping of changes of the Earth surface from Space. Although the availability of high-resolution remote sensing imagery increases significantly every year, traditional land cover analysis approaches based on pixel and object levels are not optimal. Recent advancement in deep learning has achieved remarkable success on image recognition field and has shown potential in high spatial resolution remote sensing applications, including classification and object detection. In this paper, a comprehensive review on land cover classification and object detection approaches using high resolution imagery is provided. Through two case studies, we demonstrated the applications of the state-of-the-art deep learning models to high spatial resolution remote sensing data for land cover classification and object detection and evaluated their performances against traditional approaches. For a land cover classification task, the deep-learning-based methods provide an end-to-end solution by using both spatial and spectral information. They have shown better performance than the traditional pixel-based method, especially for the categories of different vegetation. For an objective detection task, the deep-learning-based object detection method achieved more than 98% accuracy in a large area; its high accuracy and efficiency could relieve the burden of the traditional, labour-intensive method. However, considering the diversity of remote sensing data, more training datasets are required in order to improve the generalisation and the robustness of deep learning-based models.},

Short Time Fourier Transform (STFT) is employed to transform the transient responses into two-dimensional spectral frame representation. A convolutional neural network is incorporated to distinguish between the damaged and undamaged states, as well as various types of damage of the laminated composites, by automatically extracting discriminative features from the vibration-based spectrograms. The CNN showed a classification accuracy of 90.1% on one healthy and 12 delaminated cases. The study of the confusion matrix of CNN provided further insights into the physics of the problem.

In subsequent chapters, the physical mechanisms underlying the formation and progression of damage under mechanical loads are described with ample experimental data, and micro- and macro-level damage models are combined. Finally, fatigue of composite materials is discussed using fatigue-life diagrams. While there is a special emphasis on polymer matrix composites, metal and ceramic matrix composites are also described.

The velocity of propagated Lamb wave, wave amplitudes in four different distances from the actuator, and the ratio of these amplitudes to the first received wave amplitude, in three frequencies of 100, 200, and 330 kHz were extracted from the acquired signals. The extracted sensory features were used to train three types of supervised machine learning models for the crack density classification. The linear discriminant analysis (LDA) was performed for dimensional reduction to find a linear combination of features that can better discriminate the classes. Support vector machines (SVM), linear vector quantization (LVQ) neural network (NN), and multilayer perceptron (MLP) NN were used for the classification.

abstract = {Impact damage is one of the major concerns in maintenance of aircraft structures built from composite materials. Damage detection in composite materials can be divided into active and passive approaches. The active approach is usually based on various non-destructive techniques utilizing actuators and/or receivers. In contrast passive approaches do not involve any actuators; receivers are used to "sense and/or hear" any perturbations caused by possible hidden damage. Often strain data are used to localize impacts and estimate their energy. The assumption is that damage occurs above well-defined energy of impacts. The paper illustrates one active and one passive method recently developed for impact damage detection. The first method, based on guided ultrasonic waves, utilises 3-D laser vibrometry and does not require any signal processing. Simple laser scans, revealing the change in Lamb wave response amplitudes, have been used to locate delamination and estimate its severity in a composite plate. In contrast, the second method does not require any sophisticated instrumentation but relies on advanced signal processing. An array of piezoceramic sensors has been to detect strain waves transmitted from an impact applied to the composite aircraft structure. The modified multilateration procedure with Genetic Algorithms has been used to locate impact position. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {A physics-based approach to structural health monitoring (SHM) has practical shortcomings which restrict its suitability to simple structures under well controlled environments. With the advances in information and sensing technology (sensors and sensor networks), it has become feasible to monitor large/diverse number of parameters in complex real-world structures either continuously or intermittently by employing large in-situ (wireless) sensor networks. The availability of this historical data has engendered a lot of interest in a data-driven approach as a natural and more viable option for realizing the goal of SHM in such structures. However, the lack of sensor data corresponding to different damage scenarios continues to remain a challenge. Most of the supervised machine-learning/deep-learning techniques, when trained using this inherently limited data, lack robustness and generalizability. Physics-informed learning, which involves the integration of domain knowledge into the learning process, is presented here as a potential remedy to this challenge. As a step towards the goal of automated damage detection (mathematically an inverse problem), preliminary results are presented from dynamic modelling of beam structures using physics-informed artificial neural networks. Forward and inverse problems involving partial differential equations are solved and comparisons reveal a clear superiority of physics-informed approach over one that is purely datadriven vis-{\`{a}}-vis overfitting/generalization. Other ways of incorporating domain knowledge into the machine learning pipeline are then presented through case-studies on various aspects of NDI/SHM (visual inspection, impact diagnosis). Lastly, as the final attribute of an optimal SHM approach, a sensing paradigm for non-contact full-field measurements for damage diagnosis is presented.},

abstract = {Vision-based semantic segmentation in urban scenarios is a key functionality for autonomous driving. Recent revolutionary results of deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) foreshadow the advent of reliable classifiers to perform such visual tasks. However, DCNNs require learning of many parameters from raw images, thus, having a sufficient amount of diverse images with class annotations is needed. These annotations are obtained via cumbersome, human labour which is particularly challenging for semantic segmentation since pixel-level annotations are required. In this paper, we propose to use a virtual world to automatically generate realistic synthetic images with pixel-level annotations. Then, we address the question of how useful such data can be for semantic segmentation - in particular, when using a DCNN paradigm. In order to answer this question we have generated a synthetic collection of diverse urban images, named SYNTHIA, with automatically generated class annotations. We use SYNTHIA in combination with publicly available real-world urban images with manually provided annotations. Then, we conduct experiments with DCNNs that show how the inclusion of SYNTHIA in the training stage significantly improves performance on the semantic segmentation task.},

abstract = {Batch Normalization (BatchNorm) is a widely adopted technique that enables faster and more stable training of deep neural networks (DNNs). Despite its pervasiveness, the exact reasons for BatchNorm's effectiveness are still poorly understood. The popular belief is that this effectiveness stems from controlling the change of the layers' input distributions during training to reduce the so-called “internal covariate shift”. In this work, we demonstrate that such distributional stability of layer inputs has little to do with the success of BatchNorm. Instead, we uncover a more fundamental impact of BatchNorm on the training process: it makes the optimization landscape significantly smoother. This smoothness induces a more predictive and stable behavior of the gradients, allowing for faster training.},

@article{rogge2013characterization,
abstract = {Delaminations in composite laminates resulting from impact events may be accompanied by minimal indication of damage at the surface. As such, inspections are required to ensure defects are within allowable limits. Conventional ultrasonic scanning techniques have been shown to effectively characterize the size and depth of delaminations but require physical contact with the structure and considerable setup time. Alternatively, a non-contact scanning laser vibrometer may be used to measure guided wave propagation in the laminate structure generated by permanently bonded transducers. A local Fourier domain analysis method is presented for processing guided wavefield data to estimate spatially dependent wavenumber values, which can be used to determine delamination depth. The technique is applied to simulated wavefields and results are analyzed to determine limitations of the technique with regards to determining defect size and depth. Based on simulation results, guidelines for application of the technique are developed. Finally, experimental wavefield data is obtained in quasi-isotropic carbon fiber reinforced polymer (CFRP) laminates with impact damage. The recorded wavefields are analyzed and wavenumber is measured to an accuracy of up to 8.5% in the region of shallow delaminations. These results show the promise of local wavenumber domain analysis to characterize the depth of delamination damage in composite laminates. The technique can find application in automated vehicle health assurance systems with potential for high detection rates and greatly reduced operator effort and setup time. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.

@inproceedings{zhang2013understanding,
abstract = {In this paper, we are interested in understanding the semantics of outdoor scenes in the context of autonomous driving. Towards this goal, we propose a generative model of 3D urban scenes which is able to reason not only about the geometry and objects present in the scene, but also about the high-level semantics in the form of traffic patterns. We found that a small number of patterns is sufficient to model the vast majority of traffic scenes and show how these patterns can be learned. As evidenced by our experiments, this high-level reasoning significantly improves the overall scene estimation as well as the vehicle-to-lane association when compared to state-of-the-art approaches. {\textcopyright} 2013 IEEE.},

@article{Kudela2015,
abstract = {This research is related to a signal processing of full wavefield data as an effective tool for detection, localization and visualization of a crack growth in thin-walled structures. Full wavefield data of propagating Lamb waves in structures such as plates and shells made out of metallic alloys and composite laminates contain a wealth of information about wave pattern anomalies due to occurrence of a damage. The aim is to demonstrate a method for enhancing damage visualization in structures such that estimation of the length and orientation of the crack can be easily obtained. The proposed signal processing involves application of discrete fast Fourier transform, wavenumber domain filtering and inverse discrete Fourier transform. The method is further enhanced by a technique for compensation of the wave attenuation so that the effects of structural damage have the same influence regardless of the location. The concept is first illustrated on numerically simulated data, and then tested on experimental results. In the experiments, full wavefield measurements are obtained using a scanning laser Doppler vibrometer, which allows the measurement of displacements and/or velocities along three axes over a user-defined grid. In the proposed method only out-of-plane velocities are used. Tests performed on simple aluminum and composite plates with artificially introduced longitudinal cracks confirm the effectiveness of the method and its potential for application to the inspection of a variety of structural components. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

@article{Ijjeh2021,
abstract = {A novel full wavefield processing method by using fully convolutional neural networks is presented. The full wavefield of propagating Lamb waves in the fibre-reinforced composite plate was simulated by the parallel spectral element method. It resembles a full wavefield measurements acquired on a surface of the plate by the scanning laser Doppler vibrometer. The aim of the proposed technique is an identification of delamination location, size and shape. It is achieved by pixel-wise image segmentation by using the end-to-end approach. It is possible because of the large dataset of Lamb wave propagation patterns resulting from interaction with delaminations of random location, size and shape. It is demonstrated that the proposed method, tested on numerical data, is performing better than conventional adaptive wavenumber filtering method which was developed in previous work. Moreover, it enables better automation of delamination identification so that the damage map can be created without user intervention. The method was also tested on experimental data acquired on the surface of the specimen in which delamination was artificially created by a Teflon insert. The obtained results with the deep learning approach show its capability to predict the delamination in the numerically generated dataset with high accuracy compared to the conventional damage detection approach. Furthermore, the deep learning model shows the ability to generalize to a further experiential set.},
