abstract = {Convolutional networks are powerful visual models that yield hierarchies of features. We show that convolutional networks by themselves, trained end-to-end, pixels-to-pixels, improve on the previous best result in semantic segmentation. Our key insight is to build 'fully convolutional' networks that take input of arbitrary size and produce correspondingly-sized output with efficient inference and learning. We define and detail the space of fully convolutional networks, explain their application to spatially dense prediction tasks, and draw connections to prior models. We adapt contemporary classification networks (AlexNet, the VGG net, and GoogLeNet) into fully convolutional networks and transfer their learned representations by fine-tuning to the segmentation task. We then define a skip architecture that combines semantic information from a deep, coarse layer with appearance information from a shallow, fine layer to produce accurate and detailed segmentations. Our fully convolutional networks achieve improved segmentation of PASCAL VOC (30{\%} relative improvement to 67.2{\%} mean IU on 2012), NYUDv2, SIFT Flow, and PASCAL-Context, while inference takes one tenth of a second for a typical image.},

Our main contribution is a thorough evaluation of networks of increasing depth using an architecture with very small (3 × 3) convolution filters, which shows that a significant improvement on the prior-art configurations can be achieved by pushing the depth to 16-19 weight layers. These findings were the basis of our ImageNet Challenge 2014 submission, where our team secured the first and the second places in the localisa-tion and classification tracks respectively.

abstract = {Recent work has shown that convolutional networks can be substantially deeper, more accurate, and efficient to train if they contain shorter connections between layers close to the input and those close to the output. In this paper, we embrace this observation and introduce the Dense Convolutional Network (DenseNet), which connects each layer to every other layer in a feed-forward fashion. Whereas traditional convolutional networks with L layers have L connections - one between each layer and its subsequent layer - our network has L(L2+1) direct connections. For each layer, the feature-maps of all preceding layers are used as inputs, and its own feature-maps are used as inputs into all subsequent layers. DenseNets have several compelling advantages: they alleviate the vanishing-gradient problem, strengthen feature propagation, encourage feature reuse, and substantially reduce the number of parameters. We evaluate our proposed architecture on four highly competitive object recognition benchmark tasks (CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, SVHN, and ImageNet). DenseNets obtain significant improvements over the state-of-the-art on most of them, whilst requiring less computation to achieve high performance.

abstract = {State-of-the-art approaches for semantic image segmentation are built on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The typical segmentation architecture is composed of (a) a downsampling path responsible for extracting coarse semantic features, followed by (b) an upsampling path trained to recover the input image resolution at the output of the model and, optionally, (c) a post-processing module (e.g. Conditional Random Fields) to refine the model predictions. Recently, a new CNN architecture, Densely Connected Convolutional Networks (DenseNets), has shown excellent results on image classification tasks. The idea of DenseNets is based on the observation that if each layer is directly connected to every other layer in a feed-forward fashion then the network will be more accurate and easier to train. In this paper, we extend DenseNets to deal with the problem of semantic segmentation. We achieve state-of-the-art results on urban scene benchmark datasets such as CamVid and Gatech, without any further post-processing module nor pretraining. Moreover, due to smart construction of the model, our approach has much less parameters than currently published best entries for these datasets.},

@techreport{Ioffe2015,
abstract = {Training Deep Neural Networks is complicated by the fact that the distribution of each layer's inputs changes during training, as the parameters of the previous layers change. This slows down the training by requiring lower learning rates and careful parameter initialization, and makes it notoriously hard to train models with saturating nonlineari-ties. We refer to this phenomenon as internal covariate shift, and address the problem by normalizing layer inputs. Our method draws its strength from making normal-ization a part of the model architecture and performing the normalization for each training mini-batch. Batch Nor-malization allows us to use much higher learning rates and be less careful about initialization. It also acts as a regu-larizer, in some cases eliminating the need for Dropout. Applied to a state-of-the-art image classification model, Batch Normalization achieves the same accuracy with 14 times fewer training steps, and beats the original model by a significant margin. Using an ensemble of batch-normalized networks, we improve upon the best published result on ImageNet classification: reaching 4.9{\%} top-5 validation error (and 4.8{\%} test error), exceeding the accuracy of human raters.},

The method is straightforward to implement, is computationally efficient, has little memory requirements, is invariant to diagonal rescaling of the gradients, and is well suited for problems that are large in terms of data and/or parameters. The method is also appropriate for non-stationary objectives and problems with very noisy and/or sparse gradients. The hyper-parameters have intuitive interpretations and typically require little tuning. Some connections to related algorithms, on which Adam was inspired, are discussed. We also analyze the theoretical convergence properties of the algorithm and provide a regret bound on the convergence rate that is comparable to the best known results under the online convex optimization framework. Empirical results demonstrate that Adam works well in practice and compares favorably to other stochastic optimization methods. Finally, we discuss AdaMax, a variant of Adam based on the infinity norm.},

In the this article, we present our studies on Lamb wave propagation characterization and crack detection using a hybrid lead zirconate titanate (PZT)-laser vibrometer system and frequency-wave number analysis. A scanning laser Doppler vibrometer is used to acquiring high-resolution time-space Lamb wavefield excited by a PZT actuator. The recorded wavefield is then transformed to frequency-wave number domain by two-dimensional Fourier transform. Wave spectrum in the frequency-wave number domain shows clear distinction among Lamb wave modes being present. These concepts are illustrated through several experimental tests. However, the space information is lost during this transformation. A short-space two-dimensional Fourier transform is then adopted to obtain the frequency-wave number spectra at various spatial locations, resulting in the space-frequency-wave number representation, which can show how the frequency-wave number component varies with respect to space dimension. It provides a means to study the wave propagation from the perspective of wave number domain. The space-frequency-wave number analysis has successfully been used for the study of wave interaction with structural discontinuity and crack detection on an aluminum plate. {\textcopyright} The Author(s) 2013.},

This paper presents part of an experimental and analytical survey of candidate methods for in situ damage detection of composite materials. Experimental results are presented for the application of Lamb wave techniques to quasi-isotropic graphite/epoxy test specimens containing representative damage modes, including delamination, transverse ply cracks and through-holes. Linear wave scans were performed on narrow laminated specimens and sandwich beams with various cores by monitoring the transmitted waves with piezoceramic sensors. Optimal actuator and sensor configurations were devised through experimentation, and various types of driving signal were explored. These experiments provided a procedure capable of easily and accurately determining the time of flight of a Lamb wave pulse between an actuator and sensor. Lamb wave techniques provide more information about damage presence and severity than previously tested methods (frequency response techniques), and provide the possibility of determining damage location due to their local response nature. These methods may prove suitable for structural health monitoring applications since they travel long distances and can be applied with conformable piezoelectric actuators and sensors that require little power.},

The proposed methodology employs a network of transducers that are used to sequentially scan the structure before and after the presence of damage by transmitting and receiving Lamb wave pulses. A damage localization image is reconstructed by analyzing the cross-correlation of the scatter signal envelope with the excitation pulse envelope for each transducer pair. A potential damage area is then reconstructed by superimposing the image observed from each actuator and sensor signal path. Both numerical and experimental case studies are used to verify the proposed methodology for composite laminates. Three-dimensional finite element models with a transducer network consisting of four transducer elements are used in the numerical case studies. The experimental case studies employ a transducer network using four piezoelectric transducers as transmitter elements and a laser vibrometer to measure the response signals at four locations close to the transducers.

abstract = {Guided acousto-ultrasonic waves have great potential for structural health monitoring applications. Lamb waves are the most widely used guided waves for damage detection in metallic and composite structures. These waves, once introduced to a structure, can propagate long distances. Nevertheless the method still requires a significant number of transducers for monitoring large structures. Recent years have shown various applications of non-contact generation and sensing of Lamb waves. This paper proposes a new scanning technique based on laser vibrometry. The method is applied for damage detection in simple aluminium plates and validated using numerical simulations. The study shows the potential of the method for simple and rapid detection, location and monitoring of damage in structures.},

abstract = {Structural health monitoring using Lamb waves is based on guided waves introduced to a structure at one point and sensed at a different location. Actuation and sensing can be accomplished using various types of transducer. The paper demonstrates a non-contact method for low-frequency Lamb wave sensing. The technique utilizes a laser Doppler velocimeter. Lamb wave responses are enhanced using data smoothing and filtering procedures. The results are validated using classical piezoceramic-based sensing and numerical simulations. The study shows the potential of laser vibrometry for Lamb wave sensing.},

@article{Seale1998,
abstract = {Among the various techniques available, ultrasonic Lamb waves offer a convenient method of evaluating composite materials. Since the Lamb wave velocity depends on the elastic properties of a structure, an effective tool exists to monitor damage in composites by measuring the velocity of these waves. Lamb wave measurements can propagate over long distances and are sensitive to the desired in-plane elastic properties of the material. This paper describes two studies which monitor fatigue damage and two studies which monitor thermal damage in composites using Lamb waves. In the fatigue studies, the Lamb wave velocity is compared to modulus measurements obtained using strain gage measurements in the first experiment and the velocity is monitored along with the crack density in the second. In the thermal damage studies, one examines samples which were exposed to varying temperatures for a three minute duration and the second includes rapid thermal damage in composites by intense laser beams. In all studies, the Lamb wave velocity is demonstrated to be an excellent method to monitor damage in composites},

The resonance spectrum method, which is based on the study of spectra obtained by forced mechanical resonance of samples using sine-sweep excitation, was used for measuring the Ao Lamb mode phase velocity.

@article{Percival1997,
abstract = {Ultrasonic Lamb waves offer an attractive method of damage detection in composite aerospace structures. However, in order to utilise these waves fully a basic understanding of their propagation in composites is required. The propagation of Lamb waves in composites is complicated by the anisotropic lay-up which can lead to the speed of the Lamb mode being dependent on the laminate lay-up and the direction of wave propagation. This study concentrated on the fundamental symmetric mode, S0, and the fundamental anti-symmetric mode, A0. A one-dimensional finite-element model has been developed to solve for Lamb wave solutions in anisotropic layered structures. The calculated dispersion curves for various composite lay-ups are presented together with plots of the through-thickness particle and stress component amplitudes. For the S0 mode, the changes in the stress distributions and particle displacements as the frequency increases are described. Experimental measurements of the S0 group velocity for various laminate lay-ups are compared to the predicted values from the model. The work concludes with a discussion of the implications of these results when Lamb waves are utilised for impact damage detection.},
