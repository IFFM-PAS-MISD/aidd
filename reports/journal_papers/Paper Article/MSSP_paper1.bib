abstract = {In our previous work, we demonstrated how to use inductive bias to infuse a convolutional neural network (CNN) with domain knowledge from fatigue analysis for aircraft visual NDE. We would like to extend this concept to SHM and therefore in this paper, we present a novel framework called DeepSHM which involves data augmentation of captured sensor signals and formalizes a generic method for end-to-end deep learning for SHM. The study case is limited to ultrasonic guided waves SHM. The sensor signal response from a Finite-Element-Model (FEM) is pre-processed through wavelet transform to obtain the wavelet coefficient matrix (WCM), which is then fed into the CNN to be trained to obtain the neural weights. At the end of this paper, we also present the results of our investigation on CNN complexities that is needed to generalize the multitude variation of sensor signals based on experimental testing of the DeepSHM concept with Lamb wave experiment data from coupon testing.},
