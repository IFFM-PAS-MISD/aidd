abstract = {The aim of the present work is to develop a system of smart devices that could be permanently attached on the surface of the composite structure and monitor the interaction of low-frequency Lamb waves with defects. A linear array of transmitters would generate a relatively uniform wavefront allowing the inspection of large areas with a limited number of sensors. The asymmetric A0 Lamb mode is generated in carbon fibre reinforced plastic (CFRP) quasi-isotropic laminates using an array of thin piezoceramic transmitters operating in-phase. In this paper, the effect of damage size on the propagation of Lamb waves is presented. Experimental verification is also presented in multidirectional CFRP composite panels. Critical size impact damage is detected. Finally, the technique is applied to a stiffened panel. Damage on the skin or flange is detectable while damage on the web or cap is not detected with the current experimental set up. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

We begin with an overview of damage prognosis, and a description of the basic methodology of guided-wave SHM. We then review developments from the open literature in various aspects of this truly multidisciplinary field. First, we discuss different transducer technologies, including both piezoelectric and non-conventional popular and non-conventional piezoelectric transducers. Next, we examine guided-wave theory, tracing its early history down to modern developments. Following this, we detail the efforts into models for guided-wave excitation by SHM transducers. Then, we review several signal processing related works. The next topic in Section 6 is guided-wave SHM system development, and we explore various packaging ideas, integrated solutions and efforts to examine robustness to different service conditions. We also highlight the broad spectrum of applications in which this technology has been tested. We then present some investigations that have attempted to combine guided-wave approaches with other complementary SHM technologies for better system performance. Finally, we propose desirable developments for further advancement of this field. {\textcopyright} 2007 SAGE Publications.},

Affordable advanced miniaturized sensors and continuous improvement in data processing technology combined with powerful software algorithms has allowed non-destructive testing (NDT) to become an integral part of structural materials and has thus given structures a self-sensing functionality. This paper describes where to integrate SHM into the aircraft design process and how to validate the established loads monitoring process in comparison to an emerging damage monitoring solution, before more precisely describing a technology selection regarding damage monitoring.

abstract = {Lamb waves are dispersive and multi-modal, which makes the interpretation of Lamb wave signals very difficult in either the time or frequency domain. In the this article, we present our studies on Lamb wave propagation characterization and crack detection using a hybrid lead zirconate titanate (PZT)-laser vibrometer system and frequency-wave number analysis. A scanning laser Doppler vibrometer is used to acquiring high-resolution time-space Lamb wavefield excited by a PZT actuator. The recorded wavefield is then transformed to frequency-wave number domain by two-dimensional Fourier transform. Wave spectrum in the frequency-wave number domain shows clear distinction among Lamb wave modes being present. These concepts are illustrated through several experimental tests. However, the space information is lost during this transformation. A short-space two-dimensional Fourier transform is then adopted to obtain the frequency-wave number spectra at various spatial locations, resulting in the space-frequency-wave number representation, which can show how the frequency-wave number component varies with respect to space dimension. It provides a means to study the wave propagation from the perspective of wave number domain. The space-frequency-wave number analysis has successfully been used for the study of wave interaction with structural discontinuity and crack detection on an aluminum plate. {\textcopyright} The Author(s) 2013.},

abstract = {This paper presents the application of Lamb waves to inspect damage in composite laminates. The proposed methodology employs a network of transducers that are used to sequentially scan the structure before and after the presence of damage by transmitting and receiving Lamb wave pulses. A damage localization image is reconstructed by analyzing the cross-correlation of the scatter signal envelope with the excitation pulse envelope for each transducer pair. A potential damage area is then reconstructed by superimposing the image observed from each actuator and sensor signal path. Both numerical and experimental case studies are used to verify the proposed methodology for composite laminates. Three-dimensional finite element models with a transducer network consisting of four transducer elements are used in the numerical case studies. The experimental case studies employ a transducer network using four piezoelectric transducers as transmitter elements and a laser vibrometer to measure the response signals at four locations close to the transducers. The results show that the method enables the reliable detection of structural damage with locating inaccuracies of the order of a few millimeters inside as well as outside of an inspection area of 100 × 100mm2. {\textcopyright} 2009 IOP Publishing Ltd.},

Since the Lamb wave velocity depends on the elastic properties of a structure, an effective tool exists to monitor damage in composites by measuring the velocity of these waves. Lamb wave measurements can propagate over long distances and are sensitive to the desired in-plane elastic properties of the material. This paper describes two studies which monitor fatigue damage and two studies which monitor thermal damage in composites using Lamb waves. In the fatigue studies, the Lamb wave velocity is compared to modulus measurements obtained using strain gage measurements in the first experiment and the velocity is monitored along with the crack density in the second. In the thermal damage studies, one examines samples which were exposed to varying temperatures for a three minute duration and the second includes rapid thermal damage in composites by intense laser beams. In all studies, the Lamb wave velocity is demonstrated to be an excellent method to monitor damage in composites},

abstract = {Ultrasonic Lamb waves offer an attractive method of damage detection in composite aerospace structures. However, in order to utilise these waves fully a basic understanding of their propagation in composites is required. The propagation of Lamb waves in composites is complicated by the anisotropic lay-up which can lead to the speed of the Lamb mode being dependent on the laminate lay-up and the direction of wave propagation. This study concentrated on the fundamental symmetric mode, S0, and the fundamental anti-symmetric mode, A0. A one-dimensional finite-element model has been developed to solve for Lamb wave solutions in anisotropic layered structures. The calculated dispersion curves for various composite lay-ups are presented together with plots of the through-thickness particle and stress component amplitudes. For the S0 mode, the changes in the stress distributions and particle displacements as the frequency increases are described. Experimental measurements of the S0 group velocity for various laminate lay-ups are compared to the predicted values from the model. The work concludes with a discussion of the implications of these results when Lamb waves are utilised for impact damage detection.},

Experimental results are presented for the application of Lamb wave techniques to quasi-isotropic graphite/epoxy test specimens containing representative damage modes, including delamination, transverse ply cracks and through-holes. Linear wave scans were performed on narrow laminated specimens and sandwich beams with various cores by monitoring the transmitted waves with piezoceramic sensors. Optimal actuator and sensor configurations were devised through experimentation, and various types of driving signal were explored. These experiments provided a procedure capable of easily and accurately determining the time of flight of a Lamb wave pulse between an actuator and sensor. Lamb wave techniques provide more information about damage presence and severity than previously tested methods (frequency response techniques), and provide the possibility of determining damage location due to their local response nature. These methods may prove suitable for structural health monitoring applications since they travel long distances and can be applied with conformable piezoelectric actuators and sensors that require little power.},
