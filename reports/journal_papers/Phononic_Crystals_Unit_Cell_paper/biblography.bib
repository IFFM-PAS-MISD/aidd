abstract = {Phononic crystals are composite materials made of periodic distributions of inclusions embedded in a matrix. Due to their periodic structure, these materials may exhibit under certain conditions, absolute acoustic band gaps i.e. forbidden bands that are independent of the direction of propagation of the incident elastic wave. In the first part of this review paper, we present some examples of two-dimensional bulk phononic crystals i.e. two-dimensional arrays of inclusions assumed of infinite extent along the three spatial directions. We show that the bandwidth of the forbidden band depends strongly on the nature of the constituent materials (solid or fluid), as well as the contrast between the physical characteristics (density and elastic moduli) of the inclusions and of the matrix, the geometry of the array of inclusions, the inclusion shape and the filling factor of inclusions. The second part of this review paper is devoted to some possible applications of these composite materials. In particular, we show that defect modes (cavities, waveguides, stubs, etc.) inserted inside the two-dimensional periodic structure may lead to very selective frequency filters and efficient devices for the wavelength demultiplexing. We present also the possibility of sonic insulators for frequencies of the order of kHz with relatively small thicknesses of phononic crystal samples. Finally we report on the vibration modes of a two-dimensional phononic crystal plate i.e. a phononic crystal of finite thickness along the axis of the inclusions. We discuss guided modes which may occur in the band structure of the plate. Surface acoustic waves propagating in two-dimensional phononic crystals should open new perspectives in high-frequency radio-frequency devices. Throughout the paper, the methods of calculation are presented with some details and some experimental results complete the numerical predictions. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {The development of custom cellular materials has been driven by recent advances in additive manufacturing and structural topological optimization. These contemporary materials with complex topologies have better structural efficiency than traditional materials. Particularly, truss-like cellular structures exhibit considerable potential for application in lightweight structures owing to their excellent strength-to-mass ratio. Along with being light, these materials can exhibit unprecedented vibration properties, such as the phononic bandgap, which prohibits the propagation of mechanical waves over certain frequency ranges. Consequently, they have been extensively investigated over the last few years, being the cores for sandwich panels among the most important potential applications of lattice-based cellular structures. This study aims to develop a methodology for optimizing the topology of sandwich panels using cellular truss cores for bandgap maximization. In particular, a methodology is developed for designing lightweight composite panels with vibration absorption properties, which would bring significant benefits in applications such as satellites, spacecraft, aircraft, ships, automobiles, etc. The phononic bandgap of a periodic sandwich structure with a square core topology is maximized by varying the material and the geometrical properties of the core under different configurations. The proposed optimization methodology considers smooth approximations of the objective function to avoid non-differentiability problems and implements an optimization approach based on the globally convergent method of moving asymptotes. The results show that it is feasible to design a sandwich panel using a cellular core with large phononic bandgaps.},

abstract = {Designing phononic crystals by creating frequency bandgaps is of particular interest in the engineering of elastic and acoustic microstructured materials. Mathematically, the problem of optimizing the frequency bandgaps is often nonconvex, as it requires the maximization of the higher indexed eigenfrequency and the minimization of the lower indexed eigenfrequency. A novel algorithm [1] has been previously developed to reformulate the original nonlinear, nonconvex optimization problem to an iteration-specific semidefinite program (SDP). This algorithm separates two consecutive eigenvalues - effectively maximizing bandgap (or bandwidth) - by separating the gap between two orthogonal subspaces, which are comprised columnwise of "important" eigenvectors associated with the eigenvalues being bounded. By doing so, we avoid the need of computation of eigenvalue gradient by computing the gradient of affine matrices with respect to the decision variables. In this work, we propose an even more efficient algorithm based on linear programming (LP). The new formulation is obtained via approximation of the semidefinite cones by judiciously chosen linear bases, coupled with "delayed constraint generation". We apply the two convex conic formulations, namely, the semidefinite program and the linear program, to solve the bandgap optimization problems. By comparing the two methods, we demonstrate the efficacy and efficiency of the LP-based algorithm in solving the category of eigenvalue bandgap optimization problems.

To prevent checker-boarding, an effective smoothing algorithm in terms of the surrounding element's reference factors is proposed in this paper. The approach does not alter the mesh of the finite element model, nor increase the degree of freedom of the structural system, therefore, it does not affect the computational efficiency.

abstract = {The paper presents an in-depth analysis of solid locally resonant acoustic metamaterials (LRAMs) consisting of rubber-coated inclusions. Dispersion properties of two-dimensional LRAMs are studied by means of finite-element modal analysis. For an incompressible rubber, only one practically important spectral band gap is found for in-plane modes in a low-frequency range. This result is in striking contrast with the compressible coating case, previously studied in the literature. For inclusions with a circular cross-section, the lower bound of the band gap can be evaluated exactly by means of the derived analytical solution, which is also valid for compressible coatings and can therefore be used to determine lower bounds of higher band gaps as well. The influence of geometric and material parameters, filling fraction and inclusion shape on the width of the lowest band gap is investigated in detail. Based on the results of this analysis, an optimal microstructure of LRAMs yielding the widest low-frequency band gap is proposed. To achieve the band gap at the lowest possible frequencies in LRAMs suitable for practical applications, the use of the tungsten core material is advised, as a safe and economically viable alternative to commonly considered lead and gold. Two configurations of LRAM with various sizes of coated tungsten cylindrical inclusions with circular cross-section are considered. The evolution of dispersion spectra due to the presence of different inclusions is investigated, and the parameters for optimal design of LRAMs are determined. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {The use of Phononic Crystals (PnCs) as smart materials in structures and microstructures is growing due to their tunable dynamical properties and to the wide range of possible applications. PnCs are periodic structures that exhibit elastic wave scattering for a certain band of frequencies (called bandgap), depending on the geometric and material properties of the fundamental unit cell of the crystal. PnCs slabs can be represented by plane-extruded structures composed of a single material with periodic perforations. Such a configuration is very interesting, especially in Micro Electro-Mechanical Systems industry, due to the easy fabrication procedure. A lot of topologies can be found in the literature for PnCs with square-symmetric unit cell that exhibit complete 2D bandgaps; however, due to the application demand, it is desirable to find the best topologies in order to guarantee full bandgaps referred to in-plane wave propagation in the complete 3D structure. In this work, by means of a novel and fast implementation of the Bidirectional Evolutionary Structural Optimization technique, shape optimization is conducted on the hole shape obtaining several topologies, also with non-square-symmetric unit cell, endowed with complete 3D full bandgaps for in-plane waves. Model order reduction technique is adopted to reduce the computational time in the wave dispersion analysis. The 3D features of the PnC unit cell endowed with the widest full bandgap are then completely analyzed, paying attention to engineering design issues.},

The prominent feature of phononic crystals is the existence of frequency bandgaps over which the waves are stopped, or are resonated and guided within appropriate defects. Therefore, maximized bandgaps of PhPs are desirable to enhance their phononic controllability. Porous PhPs produced through perforation of a uniform background plate, in which the porous interfaces act as strong reflectors of wave energy, are relatively easy to produce. However, the research in optimization of porous PhPs and experimental validation of achieved topologies has been very limited and particularly focused on bandgaps of flexural (asymmetric) wave modes. In this paper, porous PhPs are optimized through an efficient multiobjective genetic algorithm for widest complete bandgap of mixed fundamental guided wave modes (symmetric and asymmetric) and maximized stiffness. The Pareto front of optimization is analyzed and variation of bandgap efficiency with respect to stiffness is presented for various optimized topologies. Selected optimized topologies from the stiff and compliant regimes of Pareto front are manufactured by water-jetting an aluminum plate and their promising bandgap efficiency is experimentally observed. An optimized Pareto topology is also chosen and manufactured by laser cutting a Plexiglas (PMMA) plate, and its performance in self-collimation and focusing of guided waves is verified as compared to calculated dispersion properties.},

abstract = {This paper presents a topology optimization of single material phononic crystal plate (PhP) to be produced by perforation of a uniform background plate. The primary objective of this optimization study is to explore widest exclusive bandgaps of fundamental (first order) symmetric or asymmetric guided wave modes as well as widest complete bandgap of mixed wave modes (symmetric and asymmetric). However, in the case of single material porous phononic crystals the bandgap width essentially depends on the resultant structural integration introduced by achieved unitcell topology. Thinner connections of scattering segments (i.e. lower effective stiffness) generally lead to (i) wider bandgap due to enhanced interfacial reflections, and (ii) lower bandgap frequency range due to lower wave speed. In other words higher relative bandgap width (RBW) is produced by topology with lower effective stiffness. Hence in order to study the bandgap efficiency of PhP unitcell with respect to its structural worthiness, the in-plane stiffness is incorporated in optimization algorithm as an opposing objective to be maximized. Thick and relatively thin Polysilicon PhP unitcells with square symmetry are studied. Non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm NSGA-II is employed for this multi-objective optimization problem and modal band analysis of individual topologies is performed through finite element method. Specialized topology initiation, evaluation and filtering are applied to achieve refined feasible topologies without penalizing the randomness of genetic algorithm (GA) and diversity of search space. Selected Pareto topologies are presented and gradient of RBW and elastic properties in between the two Pareto front extremes are investigated. Chosen intermediate Pareto topology, even not extreme topology with widest bandgap, show superior bandgap efficiency compared with the results reported in other works on widest bandgap topology of asymmetric guided waves, available in the literature. Finally, steady state and transient frequency response of finite thin PhP structures of selected Pareto topologies are studied and validity of obtained bandgaps is confirmed.},

While recent approaches use Bayesian optimization to adaptively select configurations, we focus on speeding up random search through adaptive resource allocation and early-stopping. We formulate hyperparameter optimization as a pure-exploration non-stochastic infinite-armed bandit problem where a predefined resource like iterations, data samples, or features is allocated to randomly sampled configurations. We introduce a novel algorithm, Hyperband, for this framework and analyze its theoretical properties, providing several desirable guarantees. Furthermore, we compare Hyperband with popular Bayesian optimization methods on a suite of hyperparameter optimization problems. We observe that Hyperband can provide over an order-of-magnitude speedup over our competitor set on a variety of deep-learning and kernel-based learning problems.},
