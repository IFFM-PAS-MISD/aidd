{
I would like to express my deepest sense of gratitude to my supervisor, Prof.~Pawe\l{} Kudela, for his guidance, encouragement, and advice from the initial stage of my Ph.D. studies till the end of helping me develop a thorough understanding of the subject and my studies.
Also, I would like to thank him for passing me his expertise and knowledge of being a scientific researcher.

I would like to express my gratitude to Dr.~Maciej Radzienski for supplying the experimental data of the full wavefield measured by SLDV.

I would like to thank my committee members for letting my defense be a good moment of time, and for their constructive comments and suggestions.

My sincere thanks to my father, Dr.~Abdullah Ijjeh, for his continuous guidance, advice, and encouragement throughout my studies.

I would like to thank my mother for her endless love, trust, encouragement, and support throughout my life.

I would like to thank my wife, Duaa, and my daughter, Raghad, for their consistent support and encouragement.

I would like to thank my brother, Dr.~Abdalraheman Ijjeh, for his consistent advice.

And finally, I would like to thank everyone who supported me during my journey of Ph.D. studies.
