abstract = {The aim of this paper is to compare the performance of four deep convolutional neural networks in the problem of image-based automated detection of concrete surface cracks in the case of a small dataset. This crack detection problem is treated as a binary classification problem, and it is solved by training a deep convolutional neural network on the small dataset. In this context, overfitting during training was the main issue to cope with and various techniques were applied to overcome this issue. The results of the experiments suggest that the best approach for this problem is to use the pretrained convolutional base of a large pretrained convolutional neural network as an automatic feature extraction method and adding a new binary classifier on top of the convolutional base. Then, at the training the new classifier and fine-tuning the last few layers of the pretrained network take place at the same time. The classification accuracy of the best deep convolutional neural network on the testing set is about 94%.},

abstract = {Non-destructive testing of concrete for defects detection, using acoustic techniques, is currently performed mainly by human inspection of recorded images. The images consist of the inside of the examined elements obtained from testing devices such as the ultrasonic tomograph. However, such an automatic inspection is time-consuming, expensive, and prone to errors. To address some of these problems, this paper aims to evaluate a convolutional neural network (CNN) toward an automated detection of flaws in concrete elements using ultrasonic tomography. There are two main stages in the proposed methodology. In the first stage, an image of the inside of the examined structure is obtained and recorded by performing ultrasonic tomography-based testing. In the second stage, a convolutional neural network model is used for automatic detection of defects and flaws in the recorded image. In this work, a large and pre-trained CNN is used. It was fine-tuned on a small set of images collected during laboratory tests. Lastly, the prepared model was applied for detecting flaws. The obtained model has proven to be able to accurately detect defects in examined concrete elements. The presented approach for automatic detection of flaws is being developed with the potential to not only detect defects of one type but also to classify various types of defects in concrete elements.},

Firstly, the feasibility of the technique put forward was verified by simulation. In this process, the composite model was regularly set down by the circular sensor array, with each sensor acting as an actuator in sequence to generate Lamb waves. Apart from that, other sensors were used to collect response signals. With regard to the damage factor, it was mainly determined by the difference between the damage signal and the non-damage signal. The probabilistic imaging algorithm was employed to carry out damage location imaging. Then, experiments were carried out so as to study the selected composite plate. Finally, the tentative outcomes have illustrated that the maximum error of damage imaging position was 7.07 mm. The relative error was 1.6%. In addition, the method has the characteristics of simple calculation and high imaging efficiency. Therefore, it has large technical potential and wide applications in the damage location and damage recognition for composite material.},

abstract = {In practical structural health monitoring applications, the environmental conditions typically vary over time. This variation can potentially affect the ultrasound detection of a sensor for damage detection, because ultrasound propagation as well as its coupling through adhesive bond layer to the sensor can be altered. In this case, a reference signal measured without structural defect under some initial condition may not be valid for comparison with the distorted signal (due to defect) that is measured under a different condition. In order to extract reference and distorted signals under the same condition at the same time, in this work we investigate a self-referencing ultrasound detection of fiber Bragg grating (FBG) by bonding an optical fiber at two different locations away from the FBG. We demonstrate that ultrasounds in a thin structure can couple to optical fiber guided ultrasounds through two adhesive bonds. We examine the ultrasounds trapped within the optical fiber, which are producing signal interference and beating behavior of the output FBG response. Based on understanding the ultrasound coupling mechanism through two adhesive bonds, finally we test the self-referencing ultrasound detection case, investigating the output FBG response that contains a combined signal of distorted and reference signals extracted through each bond.},

abstract = {Structural health monitoring (SHM) systems help in reducing maintenance cost and avoiding catastrophic failure of the structure. As a result, they have been a focus of research for the past few decades. Ideally, the methods employed should be low cost and able to detect and localize small levels of damage reliably and accurately. This paper describes a guided waves (GW) based two-step technique for damage detection and localization using fiber Bragg grating (FBG) sensors. The FBG sensors offer benefits such as the ability to be embedded and multiplexed as well as being lightweight and insensitive to electric and magnetic fields, and they have long been seen as a promising solution for the GW measurements in structures. Unfortunately, in the conventional wavelength-based interrogation they have very low signal to noise ratio and as a result low sensitivity. Therefore, the FBG sensor is incorporated in the edge filtering configuration. The major challenges in the use of FBG sensors for GW-based detection are their directional sensitivity and passive nature. The passive nature leads to the reduction in the available actuator-sensor (AS) pairs while the directionality makes the signal processing a challenge. The proposed two-step methodology overcomes these shortcomings of FBG sensors. In the first step the amplitude weighted elliptical approach is used to identify the hotspots due to the inadequate number of AS pairs, the elliptical approach is not sufficient for damage localization. Therefore, in order to further localize the damage the edge reflection based ray-tracing approach is implemented in the second step. Through the two step method, the damage is accurately located. The paper provides the proof of concept of the proposed methodology on an aluminum plate with simulated damage. The results indicate, that indeed the two-step methodology allows accurate damage localization and overcomes the possibility of false detections.},

Different fields of engineering, such as mechanical, architectural, civil, and aerospace engineering, benefit excellent mechanical properties of composite materials. Due to their heterogeneous nature, composite materials can suffer from several complex nonlinear damage modes, including impact damage, delamination, matrix crack, fiber breakage, and voids. Therefore, early damage detection of composite structures can help avoid catastrophic events and tragic consequences, such as airplane crashes, further demanding the development of robust structural health monitoring (SHM) algorithms. This study first reviews different non-destructive damage testing techniques, then investigates vibration-based damage-detection methods along with their respective pros and cons, and concludes with a thorough discussion of a nonlinear hybrid method termed the Vibro-Acoustic Modulation technique. Advanced signal processing, machine learning, and deep learning have been widely employed for solving damage-detection problems of composite structures. Therefore, all of these methods have been fully studied. Considering the wide use of a new generation of smart composites in different applications, a section is dedicated to these materials.

Novel approaches for imaging the composite panels using guided waves are discussed and demonstrated for quantitative evaluation of the delamination damage. A filter reconstruction imaging method is shown to provide a rapid technique to locate delamination damage by showing where guided wave energy is trapped. A spatial wavenumber-based imaging algorithm is applied to calculate wavenumber values at each spatial location and highlights the delamination damage as regions with larger wavenumber values. The imaging approaches are demonstrated using experimental data from a plate with a simulated delamination (teflon insert) and from a plate containing impact-induced delamination damage.

abstract = {Delaminations in composite laminates resulting from impact events may be accompanied by minimal indication of damage at the surface. As such, inspections are required to ensure defects are within allowable limits. Conventional ultrasonic scanning techniques have been shown to effectively characterize the size and depth of delaminations but require physical contact with the structure and considerable setup time. Alternatively, a non-contact scanning laser vibrometer may be used to measure guided wave propagation in the laminate structure generated by permanently bonded transducers. A local Fourier domain analysis method is presented for processing guided wavefield data to estimate spatially dependent wavenumber values, which can be used to determine delamination depth. The technique is applied to simulated wavefields and results are analyzed to determine limitations of the technique with regards to determining defect size and depth. Based on simulation results, guidelines for application of the technique are developed. Finally, experimental wavefield data is obtained in quasi-isotropic carbon fiber reinforced polymer (CFRP) laminates with impact damage. The recorded wavefields are analyzed and wavenumber is measured to an accuracy of up to 8.5% in the region of shallow delaminations. These results show the promise of local wavenumber domain analysis to characterize the depth of delamination damage in composite laminates. The technique can find application in automated vehicle health assurance systems with potential for high detection rates and greatly reduced operator effort and setup time. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Lamb waves are excited by a lead zirconate titanate transducer (PZT) mounted on the surface of a composite plate, and the out-of-plane velocity field is measured using an LDV. From the scanned time signals, wavefield images are constructed and processed to study the interaction of Lamb waves with hidden delaminations and disbonds. In particular, the frequency-wavenumber (f-k) domain filter and the Laplacian image filter are used to enhance the visibility of defects in the scanned images. Thereafter, a statistical cluster detection algorithm is used to identify the defect location and distinguish damaged specimens from undamaged ones. {\textcopyright} 2011 IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract = {Carbon Fibre Reinforced Polymer (CFRP) materials are lightweight and corrosion-resistant and therefore are increasingly used in aerospace, automotive and construction industries. In Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) applications of CFRP materials, ultrasonic guided waves potentially offer large area inspection or inspection from a remote location. This paper addresses the effect of temperature variation on guided wave propagation in highly anisotropic CFRP materials. Temperature variations cause changes in guided wave velocity that can in turn compromise the baseline subtraction procedures employed by many SHM systems for damage detection. A simple model that describes the dependence of elastic properties of the CFRP plates on temperature is presented in this paper. The model can be used to predict anisotropic velocity changes and baseline subtraction performance under varying thermal conditions. The results produced by the model for unidirectional and 0/90 CFRP plates are compared with experimental measurements.},

abstract = {Super resolution is the problem of artificially enlarging a low resolution photograph to recover a plausible high resolution version. In the regime of high magnification factors, the problem is dramatically underspecified and many plausible, high resolution images may match a given low resolution image. In particular, traditional super resolution techniques fail in this regime due to the multimodality of the problem and strong prior information that must be imposed on image synthesis to produce plausible high resolution images. In this work we propose a new probabilistic deep network architecture, a pixel recursive super resolution model, that is an extension of PixelCNNs to address this problem. We demonstrate that this model produces a diversity of plausible high resolution images at large magnification factors. Furthermore, in human evaluation studies we demonstrate how previous methods fail to fool human observers. However, high resolution images sampled from this probabilistic deep network do fool a naive human observer a significant fraction of the time.},

However, the hallucinated details are often accompanied with unpleasant artifacts. To further enhance the visual quality, we thoroughly study three key components of SRGAN – network architecture, adversarial loss and perceptual loss, and improve each of them to derive an Enhanced SRGAN (ESRGAN). In particular, we introduce the Residual-in-Residual Dense Block (RRDB) without batch normalization as the basic network building unit. Moreover, we borrow the idea from relativistic GAN to let the discriminator predict relative realness instead of the absolute value. Finally, we improve the perceptual loss by using the features before activation, which could provide stronger supervision for brightness consistency and texture recovery. Benefiting from these improvements, the proposed ESRGAN achieves consistently better visual quality with more realistic and natural textures than SRGAN and won the first place in the PIRM2018-SR Challenge (region 3) with the best perceptual index.

abstract = {A very deep convolutional neural network (CNN) has recently achieved great success for image super-resolution (SR) and offered hierarchical features as well. However, most deep CNN based SR models do not make full use of the hierarchical features from the original low-resolution (LR) images, thereby achieving relatively-low performance. In this paper, we propose a novel residual dense network (RDN) to address this problem in image SR. We fully exploit the hierarchical features from all the convolutional layers. Specifically, we propose residual dense block (RDB) to extract abundant local features via dense connected convolutional layers. RDB further allows direct connections from the state of preceding RDB to all the layers of current RDB, leading to a contiguous memory (CM) mechanism. Local feature fusion in RDB is then used to adaptively learn more effective features from preceding and current local features and stabilizes the training of wider network. After fully obtaining dense local features, we use global feature fusion to jointly and adaptively learn global hierarchical features in a holistic way. Experiments on benchmark datasets with different degradation models show that our RDN achieves favorable performance against state-of-the-art methods.},

This paper introduces FAST (Free Adaptive Super-resolution via Transfer), a framework to accelerate any SR algorithm applied to compressed videos. FAST exploits the temporal correlation between adjacent frames such that SR is only applied to a subset of frames; SR pixels are then transferred to the other frames. The transferring process has negligible computation cost as it uses information already embedded in the compressed video (e.g., motion vectors and residual). Adaptive processing is used to retain accuracy when the temporal correlation is not present (e.g., occlusions). FAST accelerates state-of-the-art SR algorithms by up to 15× with a visual quality loss of 0.2dB. FAST is an important step towards real-time SR algorithms for ultra- HD displays and energy constrained devices (e.g., phones and tablets).},

abstract = {For video super-resolution, current state-of-the-art approaches either process multiple low-resolution (LR) frames to produce each output high-resolution (HR) frame separately in a sliding window fashion or recurrently exploit the previously estimated HR frames to super-resolve the following frame. The main weaknesses of these approaches are: 1) separately generating each output frame may obtain high-quality HR estimates while resulting in unsatisfactory flickering artifacts, and 2) combining previously generated HR frames can produce temporally consistent results in the case of short information flow, but it will cause significant jitter and jagged artifacts because the previous super-resolving errors are constantly accumulated to the subsequent frames.In this paper, we propose a fully end-to-end trainable frame and feature-context video super-resolution (FFCVSR) network that consists of two key sub-networks: local network and context network, where the first one explicitly utilizes a sequence of consecutive LR frames to generate local feature and local SR frame, and the other combines the outputs of local network and the previously estimated HR frames and features to super-resolve the subsequent frame. Our approach takes full advantage of the inter-frame information from multiple LR frames and the context information from previously predicted HR frames, producing temporally consistent highquality results while maintaining real-time speed by directly reusing previous features and frames. Extensive evaluations and comparisons demonstrate that our approach produces state-of-the-art results on a standard benchmark dataset, with advantages in terms of accuracy, efficiency, and visual quality over the existing approaches.},

abstract = {Laser ultrasonic scanning is attractive for damage detection due to its noncontact nature, sensitivity to local damage, and high spatial resolution. However, its practicality is limited because scanning at a high spatial resolution demands a prohibitively long scanning time. Recently, compressed sensing (CS) and super-resolution (SR) are gaining popularity in the image recovery field. CS estimates unmeasured ultrasonic responses from measured responses, and SR recovers high spatial frequency information from low resolution images. Inspired by these techniques, a laser ultrasonic wavefield reconstruction technique is developed to localize and visualize damage with a reduced number of ultrasonic measurements. First, a low spatial resolution ultrasonic wavefield image for a given inspection region is reconstructed from reduced number of ultrasonic measurements using CS. Here, the ultrasonic waves are generated using a pulsed laser, and measured at a fixed sensing point using a laser Doppler vibrometer (LDV). Then, a high spatial resolution ultrasonic wave image is recovered from the reconstructed low spatial resolution image using SR. The number of measurement points required for ultrasonic wavefield imaging is significantly reduced over 90%. The performance of the proposed technique is validated by an experiment performed on a cracked aluminum plate.},

However, high spatial resolution, often necessary for accurate damage quantification, typically demands a long scanning time. In this work, we investigate a novel methodology to acquire high-resolution wavefields with a reduced number of measurement points to minimize the acquisition time. Such methodology is based on the combination of compressive sensing and convolutional neural networks to recover high spatial frequency information from low-resolution images. A data set was built from 652 wavefield images acquired with a laser Doppler vibrometer describing guided ultrasonic wave propagation in eight different structures, with and without various simulated defects. Out of those 652 images, 326 cases without defect and 326 cases with defect were used as a training database for the convolutional neural network. In addition, 273 wavefield images were used as a testing database to validate the proposed methodology. For quantitative evaluation, two image quality metrics were calculated and compared to those achieved with different recovery methods or by training the convolutional neural network with non-wavefield images data set. The results demonstrate the capability of the technique for enhancing image resolution and quality, as well as similarity to the wavefield acquired on the full high-resolution grid of scan points, while reducing the number of measurement points down to 10% of the number of scan points for a full grid.},

abstract = {Recently, several models based on deep neural networks have achieved great success in terms of both reconstruction accuracy and computational performance for single image super-resolution. In these methods, the low resolution (LR) input image is upscaled to the high resolution (HR) space using a single filter, commonly bicubic interpolation, before reconstruction. This means that the super-resolution (SR) operation is performed in HR space. We demonstrate that this is sub-optimal and adds computational complexity. In this paper, we present the first convolutional neural network (CNN) capable of real-time SR of 1080p videos on a single K2 GPU. To achieve this, we propose a novel CNN architecture where the feature maps are extracted in the LR space. In addition, we introduce an efficient sub-pixel convolution layer which learns an array of upscaling filters to upscale the final LR feature maps into the HR output. By doing so, we effectively replace the handcrafted bicubic filter in the SR pipeline with more complex upscaling filters specifically trained for each feature map, whilst also reducing the computational complexity of the overall SR operation. We evaluate the proposed approach using images and videos from publicly available datasets and show that it performs significantly better (+0.15dB on Images and +0.39dB on Videos) and is an order of magnitude faster than previous CNN-based methods.},

This paper presents a damage detection and localization technique based on a compressive sensing algorithm, which significantly allows us to reduce the acquisition time without losing in detection accuracy. The proposed technique exploits the sparsity of the wavefield in different representation domains, such as those spanned by wave atoms, curvelets, and Fourier exponentials to recover the full wavefield and, at the same time, to infer the damage location, based on comparison between the wavefield reconstructions produced by the different representation domains. The procedure is applied to three different setups related to an aluminum plate with a notch, a glass fiber reinforced polymer plate with a notch, and a composite plate with a delamination.

abstract = {Corrosion damage of aircraft structures can significantly reduce the structural performance and endanger flight safety. There is a pressing need for research on aircraft structural corrosion monitoring technology. Lamb wave tomography (LWT) can be used to evaluate structural corrosion. However, the conventional tomographic method needs sensors with dense array, which is not easy to be satisfied in practice and limits its application. Due to the sparsity of corrosion damage in aircraft structures, compressed sensing (CS), which is an emerging signal processing technique, can be employed to optimize LWT. This paper presents a novel CS-based tomographic method to map out the internal situation of aircraft structure. Compared to conventional LWT, the CS-based tomographic method requires fewer sensors to detect the same corrosion damage while the imaging quality still maintains. The experimental study is carried out to diagnose the real corrosion damage by the new approach. Results show the advantages of the proposed CS-based tomographic method.},

abstract = {The basis pursuit problem seeks a minimum one-norm solution of an underdeter-mined least-squares problem. Basis pursuit denoise (BPDN) fits the least-squares problem only approximately, and a single parameter determines a curve that traces the optimal trade-off between the least-squares fit and the one-norm of the solution. We prove that this curve is convex and continuously differentiable over all points of interest, and show that it gives an explicit relationship to two other optimization problems closely related to BPDN. We describe a root-finding algorithm for finding arbitrary points on this curve; the algorithm is suitable for problems that are large scale and for those that are in the complex domain. At each iteration, a spectral gradient-projection method approximately minimizes a least-squares problem with an explicit one-norm constraint. Only matrix-vector operations are required. The primal-dual solution of this problem gives function and derivative information needed for the root-finding method. Numerical experiments on a comprehensive set of test problems demonstrate that the method scales well to large problems. {\textcopyright} 2008 Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics.},

abstract = {The sparsity which is implicit in MR images is exploited to significantly undersample k-space. Some MR images such as angiograms are already sparse in the pixel representation; other, more complicated images have a sparse representation in some transform domain-for example, in terms of spatial finite-differences or their wavelet coefficients. According to the recently developed mathematical theory of compressed-sensing, images with a sparse representation can be recovered from randomly undersampled k-space data, provided an appropriate nonlinear recovery scheme is used. Intuitively, artifacts due to random undersampling add as noise-like interference. In the sparse transform domain the significant coefficients stand out above the interference. A nonlinear thresholding scheme can recover the sparse coefficients, effectively recovering the image itself. In this article, practical incoherent undersampling schemes are developed and analyzed by means of their aliasing interference. Incoherence is introduced by pseudo-random variable-density undersampling of phase-encodes. The reconstruction is performed by minimizing the ℓ1 norm of a transformed image, subject to data fidelity constraints. Examples demonstrate improved spatial resolution and accelerated acquisition for multislice fast spin-echo brain imaging and 3D contrast enhanced angiography. {\textcopyright} 2007 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

For example, wide-band next-generation systems require a high Nyquist-sampling rate, but the channel impulse response (CIR) will be very sparse at the high Nyquist frequency, given the low number of reflected propagation paths. This motivates the employment of compressive sensing based processing techniques for frugally exploiting both the limited radio resources and the network infrastructure as efficiently as possible. A diverse range of sophisticated compressed sampling techniques is surveyed, and we conclude with a variety of promising research ideas related to large-scale antenna arrays, non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA), and ultra-dense network (UDN) solutions, just to name a few.},

abstract = {Guided waves in plates, known as Lamb waves, are characterized by complex, multimodal, and frequency dispersive wave propagation, which distort signals and make their analysis difficult. Estimating these multimodal and dispersive characteristics from experimental data becomes a difficult, underdetermined inverse problem. To accurately and robustly recover these multimodal and dispersive properties, this paper presents a methodology referred to as sparse wavenumber analysis based on sparse recovery methods. By utilizing a general model for Lamb waves, waves propagating in a plate structure, and robust [script-l]1 optimization strategies, sparse wavenumber analysis accurately recovers the Lamb wave's frequency-wavenumber representation with a limited number of surface mounted transducers. This is demonstrated with both simulated and experimental data in the presence of multipath reflections. With accurate frequency-wavenumber representations, sparse wavenumber synthesis is then used to accurately remove multipath interference in each measurement and predict the responses between arbitrary points on a plate.},

abstract = {This paper describes a method to effectively image structural features and defects using local estimates of the wavenumber of propagating guided Lamb waves at a fine grid of spatial sampling points. The guided waves are rapidly excited at each grid point using a scanning Q-switched laser system and sensed by a single fixed ultrasonic transducer. Through reciprocity, this produces a full-wave-field time history of a virtual wave being excited from the transducer. Using frequency-wavenumber processing, localized wavelength estimates are obtained by isolating each wave mode, narrowband filtering to one or more high-energy frequency bands, and identifying the center-wavelength of a sliding wavenumber band-pass filter that maximizes the energy at each grid point. The approach was capable of producing detailed images of hidden wall-thinning in an aluminum plate and a steel pipe section and local impact delamination in a complicated composite component. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Local wavenumber estimation (LWE) applied to a full wavefield response is a powerful approach for detecting and characterizing defects in a composite structure. However, the narrowband nature of the traditional LWE techniques brings several challenges for application on actual test cases. This study proposes a self-reference broadband version of the LWE technique. The broadband vibrations are injected using low-power piezoelectric actuators (sine sweep signal) or using pulsed laser excitation in the thermoelastic regime. The out-of-plane velocity response of the surface is recorded using an infrared scanning laser Doppler vibrometer. The dispersive Lamb wave behavior, corresponding to the damage-free base material, is identified from the broadband vibrational response. Using the identified dispersion curves (i.e. self-reference approach), a Lamb mode passband filter bank in the wavenumber-frequency domain is constructed. Searching for the maximum bandpower density in function of the assumed material thickness provides a robust estimate of the effective local thickness of the tested component, and as such yields a detection and evaluation of damage. The performance of the self-reference broadband LWE algorithm is demonstrated on aluminum plates with various flat bottom holes, as well as on cross-ply CFRP aircraft components with a stiffener disbond and barely visible impact damage. Compared to the traditional narrowband LWE approaches, the proposed self-reference broadband LWE method allows a higher level of automation, removes the need for a priori knowledge on the material and/or defect properties, and results in an improved characterization of defects.},

An efficient broadband filter in wavenumber-frequency domain is considered, in order to calculate a mode-removed broadband weighted root mean square (WRMS) energy map of the guided waves. Compensation of the frequency-dependent wave attenuation is implemented. Because this energy map relates exclusively to abnormalities in the wave field, it shows high sensitivity to all kinds of internal damages. The proposed damage map construction method is automated, and does not require any a priori information on the inspected part or measurement conditions. Further, it is not limited to application on flat coupon samples, but can be equally applied on complex composite parts. The methods are tested on an academic case of a CFRP plate with flat bottom holes and on an industrial case of a large stiffened CFRP aircraft panel with distributed manufacturing defects. It is shown that the broadband mode-removed WRMS energy map is highly sensitive to various kinds of damages, even if they are small and deep inside the material.},

We explicitly reformulate the layers as learning residual functions with reference to the layer inputs, instead of learning unreferenced functions. We provide comprehensive empirical evidence showing that these residual networks are easier to optimize, and can gain accuracy from considerably increased depth. On the ImageNet dataset we evaluate residual nets with a depth of up to 152 layers - 8× deeper than VGG nets [40] but still having lower complexity. An ensemble of these residual nets achieves 3.57% error on the ImageNet test set. This result won the 1st place on the ILSVRC 2015 classification task. We also present analysis on CIFAR-10 with 100 and 1000 layers. The depth of representations is of central importance for many visual recognition tasks. Solely due to our extremely deep representations, we obtain a 28% relative improvement on the COCO object detection dataset.

Further, this helps to exclude overfitting of the model on training data and better predictions over unseen data. Moreover, this is the most significant strength and advantage of this approach. Also, by using this approach for validation and Levenberg-Marquardt optimizer two model layers, namely, the input layer consisting of multivariable nodes and the output layer consisting output node, will be conceptually created and validated. The internal layers will be incorporated based on the complexity of the problem. The performance of the obtained model is evaluated using the coefficient of determination.

However, in the field of semantic segmentation, where we need to perform dense per-pixel prediction, we find that the large kernel (and effective receptive field) plays an important role when we have to perform the classification and localization tasks simultaneously. Following our design principle, we propose a Global Convolutional Network to address both the classification and localization issues for the semantic segmentation. We also suggest a residual-based boundary refinement to further refine the object boundaries.

abstract = {Scene parsing is challenging for unrestricted open vocabulary and diverse scenes. In this paper, we exploit the capability of global context information by different-region-based context aggregation through our pyramid pooling module together with the proposed pyramid scene parsing network (PSPNet). Our global prior representation is effective to produce good quality results on the scene parsing task, while PSPNet provides a superior framework for pixel-level prediction. The proposed approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on various datasets. It came first in ImageNet scene parsing challenge 2016, PASCAL VOC 2012 benchmark and Cityscapes benchmark. A single PSPNet yields the new record of mIoU accuracy 85.4% on PASCAL VOC 2012 and accuracy 80.2% on Cityscapes.},

abstract = {The Dice score and Jaccard index are commonly used metrics for the evaluation of segmentation tasks in medical imaging. Convolutional neural networks trained for image segmentation tasks are usually optimized for (weighted) cross-entropy. This introduces an adverse discrepancy between the learning optimization objective (the loss) and the end target metric. Recent works in computer vision have proposed soft surrogates to alleviate this discrepancy and directly optimize the desired metric, either through relaxations (soft-Dice, soft-Jaccard) or submodular optimization (Lov{\'{a}}sz-softmax). The aim of this study is two-fold. First, we investigate the theoretical differences in a risk minimization framework and question the existence of a weighted cross-entropy loss with weights theoretically optimized to surrogate Dice or Jaccard. Second, we empirically investigate the behavior of the aforementioned loss functions w.r.t. evaluation with Dice score and Jaccard index on five medical segmentation tasks. Through the application of relative approximation bounds, we show that all surrogates are equivalent up to a multiplicative factor, and that no optimal weighting of cross-entropy exists to approximate Dice or Jaccard measures. We validate these findings empirically and show that, while it is important to opt for one of the target metric surrogates rather than a cross-entropy-based loss, the choice of the surrogate does not make a statistical difference on a wide range of medical segmentation tasks.},

abstract = {Structural health monitoring (SHM) is an emerging technology designed to automate the inspection process undertaken to assess the health condition of structures. The SHM process is classically decomposed into four sequential steps: damage detection, localization, classification, and quantification. This paper addresses damage type classification and severity quantification issues as classification problems whereby each class corresponds to a given damage type or a certain damage extent. A Support Vector Machine (SVM) is used to perform multi-class classification task. Classically, Signal Based Features (SBF) are used to train SVMs when approaching SHM from a machine learning perspective. In this work, starting from the assumption that damage causes a structure to exhibit nonlinear response, it is investigated whether the use of Nonlinear Model Based Features (NMBF) increases classification performance. NMBF are computed based on parallel Hammerstein models which are identified with an Exponential Sine Sweep (ESS) signal. A study of the sensitivity of classification performance to the noise contained in output signals is also conducted. Dimension reduction of features vector using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is carried out in order to find out if it allows robustifying the classification/quantification process suggested in this work. Simulated data on a cantilever beam with various damage types and severities as well as experimental data coming from a composite aeronautic plate with various damage severities generated with a unique and original laser process are considered for demonstration. For both application cases, results show that by introducing NMBF, classification performance is improved. Furthermore, PCA allows for high recognition rates while reducing features vector dimension.},

abstract = {Carbon fiber reinforced plastics composites have been widely used in aerospace, automotive and other fields for its superior performance. To avoid possible risks, Lamb waves-based structural heath monitoring techniques have been applied to detect the internal damage of these composites. However, due to their intrinsic high degree of anisotropy which makes the failure mode complicated under fatigue loads, an accurate and timely method for damage detection of these composites is still challenging to realize. This paper proposes a novel method for detecting the internal delamination of the carbon fiber reinforced plastics by combining deep convolutional neural network and continuous wavelet transform. This data-driven method can effectively leverage the large amount of data without relying on complex feature extraction. After converting the time series signal into a two-dimensional time–frequency image by the continuous wavelet transform technique, the convolutional neural network model is applied to classify the images. Based on the prediction results of different paths by the model, a damage localization method is also proposed for ply delamination. An experimental study is implemented to verify the effectiveness of this method. The result shows this method is a useful technique for precise diagnosis and positioning of delamination damage in the composite structures.},

abstract = {This paper presents the development of a robust automatic damage diagnosis technique that uses ultrasonic Lamb waves and a deep autoencoder (DAE) to detect and classify fatigue damage in composite structures. Piezoelectric (PZT) transducers are installed on carbon fiber reinforced polymer (CFRP) composite plate specimens to interrogate structural integrity under uniaxial fatigue loading. Fatigue damage evolution from matrix cracking to delamination is monitored by periodically acquiring the ultrasonic wave response. A deep autoencoder (DAE) model is adopted for effective tracking of ultrasonic response variations and for diagnosing fatigue damage in the composite specimens. The ultrasonic signals collected from pristine specimens are processed and used for training the DAE model. To improve the accuracy and sensitivity of the damage diagnosis, the architecture and hyperparameters of the DAE model are optimized, and a statistical detection baseline is defined to capture damage indicators. The ultrasonic signals obtained after applying additional fatigue cycles are introduced into the trained DAE model to validate the damage detection and classification capabilities. The damage sensitive features automatically extracted from the bottleneck layer of the DAE model are used to classify the fatigue damage mode. Singular value decomposition (SVD) is used to further reduce feature dimensionality. The patterns in the reduced features are then analyzed using a density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise (DBSCAN) algorithm. The results show that the proposed technique can accurately detect and classify the fatigue damage in composite structures, while removing the need for manual or signal processing-based damage sensitive feature extraction from ultrasonic signals for damage diagnosis.},

abstract = {Identification of elastic properties is relevant for both non-destructive material characterizations as well as for in-situ condition monitoring to predict any possible material degradation. In this paper, we have proposed deep learning frameworks to solve the inverse problem of material property identification using ultrasonic guided waves. The propagation of guided waves in a composite laminate is modelled using a reduced order Spectral Finite Element Method (SFEM). We have used two fundamental modes of a guided wave i.e. the anti-symmetric (A0) and the symmetric modes (S0) as inputs for the proposed deep learning models and elastic properties of a unidirectional composite laminate as outputs. The deep regression-based networks like, 1D-Convnets and LSTMs are used to map input space to target space. The performance of the algorithms is evaluated based on the mean squared loss value, coefficient of determination, and mean absolute error. It is seen that the networks can learn the inverse mapping and generalize well to unseen examples even in the presence of noise at various levels. This novel methodology can eliminate disadvantages associated with existing global optimization techniques in terms of accuracy, robustness, scale, and computational time.},

abstract = {State-of-the-art approaches for semantic image segmentation are built on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The typical segmentation architecture is composed of (a) a downsampling path responsible for extracting coarse semantic features, followed by (b) an upsampling path trained to recover the input image resolution at the output of the model and, optionally, (c) a post-processing module (e.g. Conditional Random Fields) to refine the model predictions. Recently, a new CNN architecture, Densely Connected Convolutional Networks (DenseNets), has shown excellent results on image classification tasks. The idea of DenseNets is based on the observation that if each layer is directly connected to every other layer in a feed-forward fashion then the network will be more accurate and easier to train. In this paper, we extend DenseNets to deal with the problem of semantic segmentation. We achieve state-of-the-art results on urban scene benchmark datasets such as CamVid and Gatech, without any further post-processing module nor pretraining. Moreover, due to smart construction of the model, our approach has much less parameters than currently published best entries for these datasets.},

abstract = {For many engineering and aerospace applications, detection and quantification of multiscale damage in fiberreinforced composite structures is increasing in importance. Consequently, the development of an efficient and costeffective diagnosis scheme that can accurately sense, characterize, and evaluate the existence of any form of damage will offer significant potential for improving the performance, reliability, and extending the operational life of these complex systems. We present an approach to characterize and classify different damage states in composite laminates by measuring the change in the signature of the resultant wave that propagates through the anisotropic media under forced excitation. The wave propagation is measured using surface-mounted piezoelectric transducers. Sensor signals collected from test specimens with various forms of induced damage are analyzed using a patternrecognition algorithm known as the one-class support vector machines. The one-class support-vector-machine algorithm performs automatic anomaly detection and classification of damage signatures using various features from the sensor readings. The results obtained suggest that the one-class support-vector-machine algorithm, along with appropriate preprocessing techniques, can often achieve better accuracy than the popular k-nearest-neighbor method in detecting and classifying anomalies caused by structural defects, even when the perturbations caused in the sensor signals due to different damage states are minimal.

abstract = {Acoustic Emission (AE) can be used to discriminate the different types of damage occurring in a constrained composite. However, the main problem associated with data analysis is the discrimination between the different acoustic emission sources. The objective of the cluster analysis is to separate a set of data into several classes that reflect the internal structure of the data. Indeed, cluster analysis is an important tool for investigating and interpreting data. In this paper we use two kinds of classifiers: a supervised classifier and also an unsupervised one (Kohonen's map). We combine two techniques: the k-means algorithm and the k nearest neighbours. Glass/polyester model specimens were used for the validation of the proposed methodology. We worked on polyester resin and glass/polyester unidirectional specimens, subjected to tensile loading within different configurations, awaiting preferential damage modes in the material. Moreover, single fibre composites have been tested to produce fibre breakage acoustic emission events under conditions closely approximating those encountered in a real composite. {\textcopyright}2003 Elsevier Ltd.

We have developed an optimized laser ultrasonic imaging system, which consists of a rapid pulsed laser scanning unit for ultrasonic generation and a laser Doppler vibrometer (LDV) unit for ultrasonic reception. CFRP laminates were subjected to low-velocity impact to introduce barely visible impact damage. In order to improve the signal-to-noise ratio of the detected ultrasonic signal, retroreflective tape and a signal averaging process were used. We thus successfully visualized the propagation of the pulsed Lamb A0 mode in the CFRP laminates without contact. Interactions between the Lamb waves and impact damage were clearly observed and the damage was easily detected through the change in wave propagation. Furthermore, we demonstrated that the damage could be rapidly detected without signal averaging. This method has significant advantages in detecting damage compared to the conventional method using a contact resonant ultrasonic transducer due to the absence of the ringing phenomenon when using the LDV.},

abstract = {Ultrasonic wavefield imaging with a non-contact technology can provide detailed information about the health status of an inspected structure. However, high spatial resolution, often necessary for accurate damage quantification, typically demands a long scanning time. In this work, we investigate a novel methodology to acquire high-resolution wavefields with a reduced number of measurement points to minimize the acquisition time. Such methodology is based on the combination of compressive sensing and convolutional neural networks to recover high spatial frequency information from low-resolution images. A data set was built from 652 wavefield images acquired with a laser Doppler vibrometer describing guided ultrasonic wave propagation in eight different structures, with and without various simulated defects. Out of those 652 images, 326 cases without defect and 326 cases with defect were used as a training database for the convolutional neural network. In addition, 273 wavefield images were used as a testing database to validate the proposed methodology. For quantitative evaluation, two image quality metrics were calculated and compared to those achieved with different recovery methods or by training the convolutional neural network with non-wavefield images data set. The results demonstrate the capability of the technique for enhancing image resolution and quality, as well as similarity to the wavefield acquired on the full high-resolution grid of scan points, while reducing the number of measurement points down to 10{\%} of the number of scan points for a full grid.},

Currently, in the CoDAlab group it is used an active piezoelectric system which involves the use of piezoelectric transducers that are attached to the surface of the structure in order to apply vibrational excitations and collect dynamic responses at different points. As pattern recognition technique, Principal Component Analysis is used to perform the analysis, built a base-line model of the structure without damage and, subsequently to compare the data of the current structure under test. Different indices are calculated to determine how different is the structure under test. Using these indices, it is possible to detect, classify and locate the damage by means of the contribution of each sensor to each index. These methodologies are tested using two different structures, one aircraft turbine blade and one aluminium plate, which were instrumented with seven and four Piezoelectric transducer discs respectively. Seven simulated damages were made in the aircraft turbine blade and four real damages in the aluminium plate.},

The embedded structures are vulnerable subjected to seismic effects. After the seismic load, the integrity of the embedded structures is weakened but the damage is unlikely to be directly observed by engineers; as a result, damage detection of an embedded structure is critical. In this study, the identification of the structural damage is investigated with Wavelet and Fourier transforms. With these two approaches, the structural signal in different frequency domain can be analyzed. The advantages and disadvantages of these two approaches in identifying the damage locations are compared. An outstanding advantage of the Wavelet transform is that it is able to identify the damage location, which makes this approach attractive for engineering practice. This advantage is exemplified by a cantilever beam finite element model.},

abstract = {Structural health monitoring (SHM) using guided waves is one of the only ways in which damage anywhere in a structure can be detected using a sparse array of permanently attached sensors. To distinguish damage from structural features, some form of comparison with damage-free reference data is essential, and here subtraction is considered. The detectability of damage is determined by the amplitude of residual signals from structural features remaining after the subtraction of reference data. These are non-zero due to changing environmental conditions such as temperature. In this paper, the amplitude of the residual signals is quantified for different guided-wave SHM strategies. Comparisons are made between two methods of reference signal subtraction and between two candidate sensor configurations. These studies allow estimates to be made of the number of sensors required per unit area to reliably detect a prescribed type of damage. It is shown that the number required is prohibitively high, even in the presence of modest temperature fluctuations, hence some form of temperature compensation is absolutely essential for guided-wave SHM systems to be viable. A potential solution is examined and shown to provide an improvement in signal suppression of approximately 30dB, which corresponds to two orders of magnitude reduction in the number of sensors required. {\textcopyright}2007 The Royal Society.},

However, composite materials are prone to production defects and other defects originated during exploitation, which may jeopardize the safety of such a structure. Thus, non-destructive evaluation methods that are material-independent and suitable for a wide range of defects identification are needed. In this paper, a technique for damage characterization in composite plates is proposed. In the presented non-destructive testing method, guided waves are excited by a piezoelectric transducer, attached to tested specimens, and measured by a scanning laser Doppler vibrometer in a dense grid of points. By means of signal processing, irregularities in wavefield images caused by any material defects are extracted and used for damage characterization. The effectiveness of the proposed technique is validated on four different composite panels: Carbon fiber-reinforced polymer, glass fiber-reinforced polymer, composite reinforced by randomly-oriented short glass fibers and aluminum-honeycomb core sandwich composite. Obtained results confirm its versatility and efficacy in damage characterization in various types of composite plates.},

abstract = {Training Deep Neural Networks is complicated by the fact that the distribution of each layer's inputs changes during training, as the parameters of the previous layers change. This slows down the training by requiring lower learning rates and careful parameter initialization, and makes it notoriously hard to train models with saturating nonlinearities. We refer to this phenomenon as internal covariate shift, and address the problem by normalizing layer inputs. Our method draws its strength from making normalization a part of the model architecture and performing the normalization for each training mini-batch. Batch Normalization allows us to use much higher learning rates and be less careful about initialization. It also acts as a regularizer, in some cases eliminating the need for Dropout. Applied to a state-of-the-art image classification model, Batch Normalization achieves the same accuracy with 14 times fewer training steps, and beats the original model by a significant margin. Using an ensemble of batch-normalized networks, we improve upon the best published result on ImageNet classification: reaching 4.9% top-5 validation error (and 4.8% test error), exceeding the accuracy of human raters.},

Detection of blade damage at an early stage is a critical problem, as blade failure can lead to a catastrophic outcome for the entire wind turbine system. Experimental measurements from vibration analysis were extracted from a 9 m CX-100 blade by researchers at Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL) throughout a full-scale fatigue test conducted at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) and National Wind Technology Center (NWTC). The blade was harmonically excited at its first natural frequency using a Universal Resonant EXcitation (UREX) system. In the current study, machine learning algorithms based on Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), including an Auto-Associative Neural Network (AANN) based on a standard ANN form and a novel approach to auto-association with Radial Basis Functions (RBFs) networks are used, which are optimised for fast and efficient runs.

abstract = {The damage identification process provides relevant information about the current state of a structure under inspection, and it can be approached from two different points of view. The first approach uses data-driven algorithms, which are usually associated with the collection of data using sensors. Data are subsequently processed and analyzed. The second approach uses models to analyze information about the structure. In the latter case, the overall performance of the approach is associated with the accuracy of the model and the information that is used to define it. Although both approaches are widely used, data-driven algorithms are preferred in most cases because they afford the ability to analyze data acquired from sensors and to provide a real-time solution for decision making; however, these approaches involve high-performance processors due to the high computational cost. As a contribution to the researchers working with data-driven algorithms and applications, this work presents a brief review of data-driven algorithms for damage identification in structural health-monitoring applications.

abstract = {A neural network model for a mechanism of visual pattern recognition is proposed in this paper. The network is self-organized by "learning without a teacher", and acquires an ability to recognize stimulus patterns based on the geometrical similarity (Gestalt) of their shapes without affected by their positions. This network is given a nickname "neocognitron". After completion of self-organization, the network has a structure similar to the hierarchy model of the visual nervous system proposed by Hubel and Wiesel. The network consits of an input layer (photoreceptor array) followed by a cascade connection of a number of modular structures, each of which is composed of two layers of cells connected in a cascade. The first layer of each module consists of "S-cells", which show characteristics similar to simple cells or lower order hypercomplex cells, and the second layer consists of "C-cells" similar to complex cells or higher order hypercomplex cells. The afferent synapses to each S-cell have plasticity and are modifiable. The network has an ability of unsupervised learning: We do not need any "teacher" during the process of self-organization, and it is only needed to present a set of stimulus patterns repeatedly to the input layer of the network. The network has been simulated on a digital computer. After repetitive presentation of a set of stimulus patterns, each stimulus pattern has become to elicit an output only from one of the C-cell of the last layer, and conversely, this C-cell has become selectively responsive only to that stimulus pattern. That is, none of the C-cells of the last layer responds to more than one stimulus pattern. The response of the C-cells of the last layer is not affected by the pattern's position at all. Neither is it affected by a small change in shape nor in size of the stimulus pattern. {\textcopyright} 1980 Springer-Verlag.},

The wave propagation data are used to determine the location and degree of damage in metallic and composite plates. The structural components are to be instrumented with array of actuators and sensors (PCB) able to excite and record its dynamic response. A damage index, calculated from the measured wave propagation data in a reference state (baseline) and the current state, is introduced as a determinant of structural damage. The index is a relative measure comparing the two states of the structure under the same ambient conditions. The damage index increase its intensity when the damage size increase too. Moreover, its calculation in different paths associated with the Artificial Neural Networks or Probability Ellipse methods allow to identify position and entity of the damage. Two panels made by aluminum and fabric composite material have been used for tests. A damage entities simulated as through-thickness hole with diameter equal to 6. mm has been investigated for aluminium panel while three damage entities (through-thickness hole with size equal to 2.5. mm, 4.5. mm and 9. mm) have been investigated for that in composite material. In order to get a training, needful for the application of the ANN method, finite elements analysis have been performed for the aluminum panel taking into account several damage paths. Simulations have been performed in order to characterize the propagation path of the Lamb waves in composite plate changing the damage entities from hole diameter equal to 2.5. mm up to 9. mm. Damage index for each damage size for both simulations and tests will be compared. The potential applications of these methods in developing health monitoring systems in defects-critical structures and in composite material structures are discussed.},

However, traditional physics based models do not provide an accurate representation, and classic data driven techniques, such as a support vector machine, are too simplistic to capture the complex nature of ultrasonic guide waves. To address this challenge, this paper uses a deep learning interpretation of ultrasonic guided waves to achieve fast, accurate, and automated structural damaged detection. To achieve this, full wavefield scans of thin metal plates are used, half from the undamaged state and half from the damaged state. This data is used to train our deep network to predict the damage state of a plate with 99.98% accuracy given signals from just 10 spatial locations on the plate, as compared to that of a support vector machine (SVM), which achieved a 62% accuracy.},

abstract = {A novel full wavefield processing method by using fully convolutional neural networks is presented. The full wavefield of propagating Lamb waves in the fibre-reinforced composite plate was simulated by the parallel spectral element method. It resembles a full wavefield measurements acquired on a surface of the plate by the scanning laser Doppler vibrometer. The aim of the proposed technique is an identification of delamination location, size and shape. It is achieved by pixel-wise image segmentation by using the end-to-end approach. It is possible because of the large dataset of Lamb wave propagation patterns resulting from interaction with delaminations of random location, size and shape. It is demonstrated that the proposed method, tested on numerical data, is performing better than conventional adaptive wavenumber filtering method which was developed in previous work. Moreover, it enables better automation of delamination identification so that the damage map can be created without user intervention. The method was also tested on experimental data acquired on the surface of the specimen in which delamination was artificially created by a Teflon insert. The obtained results with the deep learning approach show its capability to predict the delamination in the numerically generated dataset with high accuracy compared to the conventional damage detection approach. Furthermore, the deep learning model shows the ability to generalize to a further experiential set.},

abstract = {Timely monitoring the large-scale civil structure is a tedious task demanding expert experience and significant economic resources. Towards a smart monitoring system, this study proposes a hybrid deep learning algorithm aiming for structural damage detection tasks, which not only reduces required resources, including computational complexity, data storage but also has the capability to deal with different damage levels. The technique combines the ability to capture local connectivity of Convolution Neural Network and the well-known performance in accounting for long-term dependencies of Long-Short Term Memory network, into a single end-to-end architecture using directly raw acceleration time-series without requiring any signal preprocessing step. The proposed approach is applied to a series of experimentally measured vibration data from a three-story frame and successful in providing accurate damage identification results. Furthermore, parametric studies are carried out to demonstrate the robustness of this hybrid deep learning method when facing data corrupted by random noises, which is unavoidable in reality.

abstract = {Recent developments tools and techniques for structural health monitoring allow the design of early warning systems for the damage diagnosis and structural assessment. Most methods to damage detection involve vibration data analysis by using identification systems that generally require a mathematical model and much information about the system, such as parameters and states that are mostly unknown. In this paper, a novel frequency domain convolutional neural network (FDCNN) proposed aims to design an identification system for damage detection based on Bouc–Wen hysteretic model. FDCNN, unlike other works, only requires acceleration measurements for damage diagnosis that are very sensitive to environmental noise. In contrast to neural network (NN) and time domain convolutional neural network, FDCNN reduces the computational time required for the learning stage and adds robustness against noise in data. The FDCNN includes random filters in the frequency domain to avoid measurement noise using a spectral pooling operation, which is useful when the system bandwidth is unknown. Incorrect filtering can produce unwanted results, as a shifted and attenuation signal relative to the original. Moreover, FDCNN allows overcoming the parameterization problem in nonlinear systems, which is often difficult to achieve. In order to validate the proposed methodology, a comparison between two different architectures of convolutional neural networks is made, showing that proposed CNN in frequency domain brings better performance in the identification system for damage diagnosis in building structures. Experimental results from reducing scale two-storey building confirm the effectiveness of the proposed.},

abstract = {This study presents a convolutional neural network (CNN)-based response estimation model for structural health monitoring (SHM) of tall buildings subject to wind loads. In this model, the wind-induced responses are estimated by CNN trained with previously measured sensor signals; this enables the SHM system to operate stably even when a sensor fault or data loss occurs. In the presented model, top-level wind-induced displacement in the time and frequency domains, and wind data in the frequency domain are configured into the input map of the CNN to reflect the resisting capacity of a tall building, the change in the dynamic characteristics of the building due to wind loads, and the relationship between wind load and the building. To evaluate stress, which is used as a safety indicator for structural members in the building, the maximum and minimum strains of columns are set as the output layer of the CNN. The CNN is trained using measured wind and wind response data to predict the column strains during a future wind load. The presented model is validated using data from a wind tunnel test of a building model. The performance of the presented model is verified through strain estimation with data that were not used in the CNN training. To assess the validity of the presented input map configuration, the estimation performance is compared with a CNN that considered only the time domain responses as input. Furthermore, the effects of the variations in the configuration of the CNN on the wind response estimation performance are examined.},

abstract = {Structural health monitoring (SHM) is used worldwide for managing and maintaining civil infrastructures. SHM systems have produced huge amounts of data, but the effective monitoring, mining, and utilization of this data still need in-depth study. SHM data generally includes multiple types of anomalies caused by sensor faults or system malfunctions that can disturb structural analysis and assessment. In the routine data pre-processing, multiple signal processing techniques are required to detect the anomalies, respectively, which is inefficient. The large variations of extracted features from massive SHM data make the data anomaly detection techniques prone to be over-processed or under-processed. Even with expert intervention, the parameter tuning, associated with multiple data preprocessing methods, is still a challenge, making the procedure expensive and inefficient. In addition, one data anomaly detection technique frequently mis-detects other types of anomaly. In this work, we focus on the anomaly detection in the stage of data pre-processing that little work has been done based on the real-world continuous SHM data with multiclass anomalies. We proposed a novel data anomaly detection method based on a convolutional neural network (CNN) that imitates human vision and decision making. First, we split raw time series data into sections, and visualized the data in time and frequency domain, respectively. Then each section's images were stacked as a single dual-channel image and labeled according to graphical features (multi-2D image space expression). Second, a CNN was designed and trained for data anomaly classification, during which the descriptions and representations of the anomalies' features were learned by convolution. To validate our work, we considered the effects of balanced and imbalanced training sets and training ratios on actual acceleration data from an SHM system for a long-span cable-stayed bridge. The results show that our method could detect the multipattern anomalies of SHM data efficiently with high accuracy. The proposed dual-information CNN-based design makes this detection process readily scalable, faster, and more accurate, thereby providing a novel perspective with strong potential for SHM data preprocessing.},

abstract = {The widespread application of sophisticated structural health monitoring systems in civil infrastructures produces a large volume of data. As a result, the analysis and mining of structural health monitoring data have become hot research topics in the field of civil engineering. However, the harsh environment of civil structures causes the data measured by structural health monitoring systems to be contaminated by multiple anomalies, which seriously affect the data analysis results. This is one of the main barriers to automatic real-time warning, because it is difficult to distinguish the anomalies caused by structural damage from those related to incorrect data. Existing methods for data cleansing mainly focus on noise filtering, whereas the detection of incorrect data requires expertise and is very time-consuming. Inspired by the real-world manual inspection process, this article proposes a computer vision and deep learning–based data anomaly detection method. In particular, the framework of the proposed method includes two steps: data conversion by data visualization, and the construction and training of deep neural networks for anomaly classification. This process imitates human biological vision and logical thinking. In the data visualization step, the time series signals are transformed into image vectors that are plotted piecewise in grayscale images. In the second step, a training dataset consisting of randomly selected and manually labeled image vectors is input into a deep neural network or a cluster of deep neural networks, which are trained via techniques termed stacked autoencoders and greedy layer-wise training. The trained deep neural networks can be used to detect potential anomalies in large amounts of unchecked structural health monitoring data. To illustrate the training procedure and validate the performance of the proposed method, acceleration data from the structural health monitoring system of a real long-span bridge in China are employed. The results show that the multi-pattern anomalies of the data can be automatically detected with high accuracy.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2018 SPIE. Many convolutional neural networks (CNN)-based approaches were proposed and applied to detect damage in various civil structures in recent years. Usually, the training process of the classical CNN requires a large number of labeled data which is from the monitored structure in undamaged and various damaged scenarios. However, it is impractical to acquire sufficient data that can be exactly labeled with damaged from the infrastructures in service as training data. Thus, we propose a novel unsupervised CNN-based approach to automatically extract optimal feature representations from the unlabeled data in a single class. In the case study, a known dataset from an undamaged scenario is used to train CNN and a dataset from an unknown scenario is used to test the trained CNN. The proposed approach in unsupervised learning is capable of extracting feature representations from the raw acceleration signals that are sensitive to the presence of damage. Then, the extracted damage-sensitive features are fed into a one-class support vector machine (OC-SVM) for novelty detection. The feature set from the undamaged dataset is taken as training dataset to train the OC-SVM, and the extracted features from the unknown dataset are used for testing. In order to verify the effectiveness of the proposed approach in structural damage localization, a number of accelerometers are used to acquire sufficient raw acceleration data from a lab-scale steel bridge, and the preliminary experimental results show that the proposed novel CNN-based approach performs very well in damage localization.},

abstract = {Structural health monitoring (SHM) and vibration-based structural damage detection have been a continuous interest for civil, mechanical and aerospace engineers over the decades. Early and meticulous damage detection has always been one of the principal objectives of SHM applications. The performance of a classical damage detection system predominantly depends on the choice of the features and the classifier. While the fixed and hand-crafted features may either be a sub-optimal choice for a particular structure or fail to achieve the same level of performance on another structure, they usually require a large computation power which may hinder their usage for real-time structural damage detection. This paper presents a novel, fast and accurate structural damage detection system using 1D Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) that has an inherent adaptive design to fuse both feature extraction and classification blocks into a single and compact learning body. The proposed method performs vibration-based damage detection and localization of the damage in real-time. The advantage of this approach is its ability to extract optimal damage-sensitive features automatically from the raw acceleration signals. Large-scale experiments conducted on a grandstand simulator revealed an outstanding performance and verified the computational efficiency of the proposed real-time damage detection method.},

The precursory micro-cracking activity and fracture behavior of crumb rubber concrete with different rubber contents, 0%, 10%, and 15%, were analyzed. The various acoustic emission statistical parameters including cumulative event, frequency distribution, amplitude distribution, and b-value were used for the analysis. The general fracture process is similar for all normal and crumb rubber concretes and can be divided into three distinct stages of micro-crack activity, namely, early stage, main collapse stage, and post-fracture stage. The following conclusions were drawn from the analysis: (1) more micro-cracks initiated and grew at early stage in the normal concrete, while less micro-cracks in the crumb rubber concrete but with longer stage duration; (2) the duration and crack number are both increasing with the increase in the rubber contents in main collapse and post-fracture stages; (3) new crack types associated with the rubber particles were recorded due to the change of the peak frequencies; and (4) the amplitude of the cracks decrease with the increase in the rubber content due to the damping ratio and interface improvement by the mixed rubbers. The results obtained in this article demonstrate that the acoustic emission technique can provide valuable information for a better understanding of micro-cracking and fracture monitoring of crumb rubber concrete.},

abstract = {14. Sponsoring Agency Code-15. Supplementary Notes-16. Abstract Concrete cracking is a ubiquitous phenomenon, present in all types of concrete structures. Identifying and tracking the amount and severity of cracking is paramount to evaluating the current condition and predicting the future service life of a concrete asset. Concrete cracks can indicate reinforcement corrosion, the development of spalls or changing support conditions. Therefore, monitoring cracks during the life span of concrete structures has been an effective technique to evaluate the level of safety and preparing plans for future appropriate rehabilitation. One growing technique are unmanned inspections using Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV). UAVs are drones equipped with cameras, sensors, GPS, etc. RGB images (color images in Red, Green and Blue color space) are obtained from a camera mounted on a UAV flying around the structure, to detect cracks and other defects. Each image captured by UAV needs to be evaluated to track the crack formations. To save time, this task can be done by applying image processing techniques to automatically detect and report cracks rather than using a human to identify them. In addition, processing RGB images with sufficient information, such as the distance of camera to surface for each picture, will provide the dimension of the cracks (length and width).},

@article{Hochreiter1997,
abstract = {Learning to store information over extended time intervals by recurrent backpropagation takes a very long time, mostly because of insufficient, decaying error backflow. We briefly review Hochreiter's (1991) analysis of this problem, then address it by introducing a novel, efficient, gradient-based method called long short-term memory (LSTM). Truncating the gradient where this does not do harm, LSTM can learn to bridge minimal time lags in excess of 1000 discrete-time steps by enforcing constant error flow through constant error carousels within special units. Multiplicative gate units learn to open and close access to the constant error flow. LSTM is local in space and time; its computational complexity per time step and weight is O(1). Our experiments with artificial data involve local, distributed, real-valued, and noisy pattern representations. In comparisons with real-time recurrent learning, back propagation through time, recurrent cascade correlation, Elman nets, and neural sequence chunking, LSTM leads to many more successful runs, and learns much faster. LSTM also solves complex, artificial long-time-lag tasks that have never been solved by previous recurrent network algorithms.},

abstract = {Backpropagation is now the most widely used tool in the field of artificial neural networks. At the core of backpropagation is a method for calculating derivatives exactly and efficiently in any large system made up of elementary subsystems or calculations which are represented by known, differentiable functions; thus, backpropagation has many applications which do not involve neural networks as such. This paper first reviews basic backpropagation, a simple method which is now being widely used in areas like pattern recognition and fault diagnosis. Next, it presents the basic equations for back-propagation through time, and discusses applications to areas like pattern recognition involving dynamic systems, systems identification, and control. Finally, it describes further extensions of this method, to deal with systems other than neural networks, systems involving simultaneous equations or true recurrent networks, and other practical issues which arise with this method. Pseudocode is provided to clarify the algorithms. The chain rule forordered derivatives—the theorem which underlies backpropagation—is briefly discussed. {\textcopyright} 1990, IEEE},

The neural network, which has 60 million parameters and 650,000 neurons, consists of five convolutional layers, some of which are followed by max-pooling layers, and three fully connected layers with a final 1000-way softmax. To make training faster, we used nonsaturating neurons and a very efficient GPU implementation of the convolution operation. To reduce overfitting in the fully connected layers we employed a recently developed regularization method called "dropout" that proved to be very effective. We also entered a variant of this model in the ILSVRC-2012 competition and achieved a winning top-5 test error rate of 15.3%, compared to 26.2% achieved by the second-best entry.},

Convergence results for the family of Tweedie's compound Poisson models, which are usually used for general insurance pricing, are provided. In the context of a French motor third-party liability insurance example, the nagging predictor achieves stability at portfolio level after about 20 runs. At an insurance policy level, we show that for some policies up to 400 neural network runs are required to achieve stability. Since working with 400 neural networks is impractical, we calibrate two meta models to the nagging predictor, one unweighted, and one using the coefficient of variation of the nagging predictor as a weight, finding that these latter meta networks can approximate the nagging predictor well, only with a small loss of accuracy.},

Compared with other decision tree induction techniques that are based upon recursive partitioning employing greedy searches to choose the best splitting attribute and value at each node that will necessarily miss regions of the search space, the genetic programming based approach can overcome the problem. However, the method still requires the discretization of the often continuous-valued toxicity endpoints prior to the tree induction. A novel extension of this method, YAdapt, is introduced in this work which models the original continuous endpoint by adaptively finding suitable ranges to describe the endpoints during the tree induction process, removing the need for discretization prior to tree induction and allowing the ordinal nature of the endpoint to be taken into account in the models built.},

abstract = {A physics-based approach to structural health monitoring (SHM) has practical shortcomings which restrict its suitability to simple structures under well controlled environments. With the advances in information and sensing technology (sensors and sensor networks), it has become feasible to monitor large/diverse number of parameters in complex real-world structures either continuously or intermittently by employing large in-situ (wireless) sensor networks. The availability of this historical data has engendered a lot of interest in a data-driven approach as a natural and more viable option for realizing the goal of SHM in such structures. However, the lack of sensor data corresponding to different damage scenarios continues to remain a challenge. Most of the supervised machine-learning/deep-learning techniques, when trained using this inherently limited data, lack robustness and generalizability. Physics-informed learning, which involves the integration of domain knowledge into the learning process, is presented here as a potential remedy to this challenge. As a step towards the goal of automated damage detection (mathematically an inverse problem), preliminary results are presented from dynamic modelling of beam structures using physics-informed artificial neural networks. Forward and inverse problems involving partial differential equations are solved and comparisons reveal a clear superiority of physics-informed approach over one that is purely datadriven vis-{\`{a}}-vis overfitting/generalization. Other ways of incorporating domain knowledge into the machine learning pipeline are then presented through case-studies on various aspects of NDI/SHM (visual inspection, impact diagnosis). Lastly, as the final attribute of an optimal SHM approach, a sensing paradigm for non-contact full-field measurements for damage diagnosis is presented.},

Firstly, it demonstrates that Lamb wave ultrasonic tomography can be used to accurately map material loss on an exposed aircraft surface with sensors embedded on the structure's hidden surface. Hidden, in this case, refers to the surface that is not exposed to the atmosphere - the underneath of an aircraft wing, for example. Secondly, it compares tomographic images generated by fan-beam back projection and the signal difference coefficient methods, showing clearly that the latter are more sensitive to material loss. {\textcopyright} 2006 IOP Publishing Ltd.},

Central to the approach is the computation of a set of vectors, designated as damage locating vectors $\sim$DLVs! that have the property of inducing stress fields whose magnitude is zero in the damaged elements $\sim$small in the presence of truncations and approximations!. The DLVs are associated with sensor coordinates and are computed systematically as the null space of the change in measured flexibility. The localization approach based on the use of DLVs is not structure type dependent and can be applied to single or multiple element damage scenarios. Knowledge about the system is restricted to that needed for a static analysis in the undamaged state, namely, the undamaged topology and, if the structure is indeterminate, the relative stiffness characteristics.

For this purpose, four machine learning algorithms are applied based on the auto-associative neural network, factor analysis, Mahalanobis distance, and singular value decomposition. A base-excited three-story frame structure was tested in laboratory environment to obtain time-series data from an array of accelerometers under several structural state conditions. Tests were performed with varying stiffness and mass conditions with the assumption that these sources of variability are representative of changing operational and environmental conditions. Damage is simulated through nonlinear effects introduced by a bumper mechanism that induces a repetitive, impact-type nonlinearity. This mechanism intends to simulate the cracks that open and close under dynamic loads or loose connections that rattle. The unique contribution of this study is a direct comparison of the four proposed machine learning algorithms that have been reported as reliable approaches to separate structural conditions with changes resulting from damage from changes caused by operational and environmental variations. {\textcopyright} The Author(s) 2010.},

@article{torres2014data,
abstract = {This article is concerned with the experimental validation of a structural health monitoring methodology for damage detection and identification. Three different data-driven multivariate algorithms are considered here to obtain the baseline pattern. These are based on principal component analysis, independent component analysis and hierarchical non-linear principal component analysis. The contribution of this article is to examine and compare the three proposed algorithms that have been reported as reliable methods for damage detection and identification. The approach is based on a distributed piezoelectric active sensor network for the excitation and detection of structural dynamic responses. A woven multilayered composite plate and a simplified aircraft composite skin panel are used as examples to test the approaches. Data-driven baseline patterns are built when the structure is known to be healthy from wavelet coefficients of the structural dynamic responses. Damage is then simulated by adding masses at different positions of the structures. The data from the structure in different states (damaged or not) are then projected into the different models by each actuator in order to generate the input feature vectors of a self-organizing map from the computed components together with squared prediction error measures. All three methods are shown to be successful in detecting and classifying the simulated damages. At the end, a critical comparison is given in order to investigate the advantages and disadvantages of each method for the damage detection and identification tasks. {\textcopyright} The Author(s) 2013.},

abstract = {The rapid identification of kudzu powder of different origins is of great significance for studying the authenticity identification of Chinese medicine. The feasibility of rapidly identifying kudzu powder origin was investigated based on laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS) technology combined with chemometrics methods. The discriminant models based on the full spectrum include extreme learning machine (ELM), soft independent modeling of class analogy (SIMCA), K-nearest neighbor (KNN) and random forest (RF), and the accuracy of models was more than 99.00%. The prediction results of KNN and RF models were best: the accuracy of calibration and prediction sets of kudzu powder from different producing areas both reached 100%. The characteristic wavelengths were selected using principal component analysis (PCA) loadings. The accuracy of calibration set and the prediction set of discrimination models, based on characteristic wavelengths, is all higher than 98.00%. Random forest and KNN have the same excellent identification results, and the accuracy of calibration and prediction sets of kudzu powder from different producing areas reached 100%. Compared with the full spectrum discriminant analysis model, the discriminant analysis model based on the characteristic wavelength had almost the same discriminant effects, and the input variables were reduced by 99.92%. The results of this research show that the characteristic wavelength can be used instead of the LIBS full spectrum to quickly identify kudzu powder from different producing areas, which had the advantages of reducing input, simplifying the model, increasing the speed and improving the model effect. Therefore, LIBS technology is an effective method for rapid identification of kudzu powder from different habitats. This study provides a basis for LIBS to be applied in the genuineness and authenticity identification of Chinese medicine.},

abstract = {In recent years, the interest for the automatic evaluation of the state of civil structures is increased. The development of Structural Health Monitoring is allowed by the low costs of the hardware and the improving of the computational capacity of computers that can analyze considerable amount of data in short time. A Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) system should continuously monitor structures, extracting and processing relevant information, to efficiently allocate the resources for maintenance and ensure the security of the structure. Considering the latest developments in this field, great attention has been paid to data-based approaches, especially to autoregressive models; these econometric models, born in the field of finance, are usually used to analyze the vibration time series provided by the sensors applied on the monitored structures. Indexes based on these autoregressive models can be used as features by which the structural integrity can be assessed. This work proposes the application of a multivariable analysis, Principal Component Analysis (PCA), to the set of the autoregressive model parameters estimated on the vibration responses of a real structure under operational conditions. This approach reduces a complex set of data to a lower dimension, by representing the behavior of the structure through the few variables. This work uses the principal components of the autoregressive model parameters as indicators that can effectively describe different operational levels and some important environmental effects. The strategy is applied for the first time on the data collected by the long-time monitoring system installed on the stands of the G. Meazza stadium in Milan. The results will show that this procedure is effective in representing the status of the structure and can be used in a structural health monitoring prospective.},

abstract = {Long-term structural health monitoring (SHM) has become an important tool to ensure the safety of infrastructures. However, determining methods to extract valuable information from large amounts of data from SHM systems for effective identification of damage still remains a major challenge. This paper provides a novel effective method for structural damage detection by introduction of space and time windows in the traditional principal component analysis (PCA) technique. Numerical results with a planar beam model demonstrate that, due to the presence of space and time windows, the proposed double-window PCA method (DWPCA) has a higher sensitivity for damage identification than the previous method moving PCA (MPCA), which combines only time windows with PCA. Further studies indicate that the developed approach, as compared to the MPCA method, has a higher resolution in localizing damage by space windows and also in quantitative evaluation of damage severity. Finally, a finite-element model of a practical bridge is used to prove that the proposed DWPCA method has greater sensitivity for damage detection than traditional methods and potential for applications in practical engineering.},

@article{fan2011vibration,
abstract = {A comprehensive review on modal parameter-based damage identification methods for beam- or plate-type structures is presented, and the damage identification algorithms in terms of signal processing are particularly emphasized. Based on the vibration features, the damage identification methods are classified into four major categories: natural frequency-based methods, mode shape-based methods, curvature mode shape-based methods, and methods using both mode shapes and frequencies, and their merits and drawbacks are discussed. It is observed that most mode shape-based and curvature mode shape-based methods only focus on damage localization. In order to precisely locate the damage, the mode shape-based methods have to rely on optimization algorithms or signal processing techniques; while the curvature mode shape-based methods are in general a very effective type of damage localization algorithms. As an implementation, a comparative study of five extensively-used damage detection algorithms for beam-type structures is conducted to evaluate and demonstrate the validity and effectiveness of the signal processing algorithms. This brief review aims to help the readers in identifying starting points for research in vibration-based damage identification and structural health monitoring and guides researchers and practitioners in better implementing available damage identification algorithms and signal processing methods for beam- or plate-type structures.},

abstract = {In this paper some usual vibration-based damage identification techniques (VBDIT) will be reviewed and used for structural damage evaluation. With the help of a simple supported beam with different damage levels the reliability of these techniques will be investigated. The techniques reviewed herein are based on measured modal parameters which use only few mode shapes and/or modal frequencies of the structure that can be easily obtained by dynamic tests. In other words, by realizing two sets of dynamic measurements, corresponding to two moments of the structure lifetime, the dynamic modal parameters can be obtained. In order to assess properly the performance of these techniques different noise levels are randomly introduced to the response signals of a simulated beam which is exited by a random force. For different levels of damage and noise, the probabilities of damage detection and the probabilities of false alarm for the total number of simulations is evaluated. It can be concluded that among the evaluated techniques the strain energy method presents the best stability regarding noisy signals; however, the detection judgement depends on a threshold level which is discussed in this paper. The change in mode shape curvature, change in flexibility and change in flexibility curvature methods are also capable to detect and localise damaged elements but in the case of complex and simultaneous damages these techniques show less efficiency. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

These algorithms are especially relevant in cases where the damage-sensitive features extracted from the structural responses are affected by changes caused by operational and environmental variability and changes caused by damage. State-of-the-art machine learning algorithms are presented based on Mahalanobis squared distance (MSD), Gaussian mixture models (GMMs), principal component analysis (PCA), kernel principal component analysis (KPCA), and autoassociative neural network (ANN); the bioinspired algorithms are highlighted as promising algorithms to overcome some of the limitations of the more traditional ones. All the algorithms present different working principles and seek to generalize the normal structural condition in order to detect deviations, from the baseline condition, associated with damage. The applicability of the chosen algorithms for damage detection will be tested on standard data sets from the Z-24 Bridge in Switzerland. These data sets are unique as they combine 1-year monitoring from the baseline condition, when influenced by extreme operational and environmental variability, with realistic damage scenarios.},

Vibration-based damage detection is a primary tool that is employed for this monitoring. Next, the process of vibration-based damage detection will be described as a problem in statistical pattern recognition. This process is composed of three portions: (i) data acquisition and cleansing; (ii) feature selection and data compression; and (iii) statistical model development. Current research regarding feature selection and statistical model development will be emphasized with the application of this technology to a large-scale laboratory structure.},

abstract = {In broad terms, there are two approaches to damage identification. Model-driven methods establish a high-fidelity physical model of the structure, usually by finite element analysis, and then establish a comparison metric between the model and the measured data from the real structure. If the model is for a system or structure in normal (i.e. undamaged) condition, any departures indicate that the structure has deviated from normal condition and damage is inferred. Data-driven approaches also establish a model, but this is usually a statistical representation of the system, e.g. a probability density function of the normal condition. Departures from normality are then signalled by measured data appearing in regions of very low density. The algorithms that have been developed over the years for data-driven approaches are mainly drawn from the discipline of pattern recognition, or more broadly, machine learning. The object of this paper is to illustrate the utility of the data-driven approach to damage identification by means of a number of case studies.},

Here, damage is defined as changes to the material and/or geometric properties of these systems, including changes to the boundary conditions and system connectivity, which adversely affect the system's performance. A wide variety of highly effective local non-destructive evaluation tools are available for such monitoring. However, the majority of SHM research conducted over the last 30 years has attempted to identify damage in structures on a more global basis. The past 10 years have seen a rapid increase in the amount of research related to SHM as quantified by the significant escalation in papers published on this subject. The increased interest in SHM and its associated potential for significant life-safety and economic benefits has motivated the need for this theme issue. This introduction begins with a brief history of SHM technology development. Recent research has begun to recognize that the SHM problem is fundamentally one of the statistical pattern recognition (SPR) and a paradigm to address such a problem is described in detail herein as it forms the basis for organization of this theme issue. In the process of providing the historical overview and summarizing the SPR paradigm, the subsequent articles in this theme issue are cited in an effort to show how they fit into this overview of SHM. In conclusion, technical challenges that must be addressed if SHM is to gain wider application are discussed in a general manner. {\textcopyright} 2006 The Royal Society.},

The implementation is realised by using Matlab Parallel Computing Toolbox and optimized for Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) computation. In this way, considerable computation speed-up can be achieved in comparison to computation on conventional processors. The implementation includes an interpolation of wavefield on a uniform grid. The method was tested on experimental data set available on the Open Guided Waves platform. The qualitative comparison was performed on full wavefield data, whereas quantitative comparison was made directly on signals of propagating Lamb waves registered by piezoelectric transducers. In both cases, good agreement between numerical and experimental results was achieved. The proposed method is particularly useful for structural health monitoring algorithms in which signal parameters are required such as wave velocity dependence on the angle of propagation. Moreover, it enables model-assisted damage size estimation in which the damage influence curve is estimated based on large numerical data sets and sparse experimental data. Due to relatively short computation times, large data sets can be generated and used for machine learning or other soft computing methods opening up new possibilities in health monitoring of metallic and composite structures.},

abstract = {The aim of this research is an analysis of full wavefield Lamb wave interaction with impact-induced damage at various impact energies in order to find out the limitation of the wavenumber adaptive image filtering method. In other words, the relation between impact energy and damage detectability will be shown. A numerical model based on the time domain spectral element method is used for modeling of Lamb wave propagation and interaction with barely visible impact damage in a carbon-epoxy laminate. Numerical studies are followed by experimental research on the same material with an impact damage induced by various energy and also a Teflon insert simulating delamination. Wavenumber adaptive image filtering and signal processing are used for damage visualization and assessment for both numerical and experimental full wavefield data. It is shown that it is possible to visualize and assess the impact damage location, size and to some extent severity by using the proposed technique.},

abstract = {This research is related to a signal processing of full wavefield data as an effective tool for detection, localization and visualization of a crack growth in thin-walled structures. Full wavefield data of propagating Lamb waves in structures such as plates and shells made out of metallic alloys and composite laminates contain a wealth of information about wave pattern anomalies due to occurrence of a damage. The aim is to demonstrate a method for enhancing damage visualization in structures such that estimation of the length and orientation of the crack can be easily obtained. The proposed signal processing involves application of discrete fast Fourier transform, wavenumber domain filtering and inverse discrete Fourier transform. The method is further enhanced by a technique for compensation of the wave attenuation so that the effects of structural damage have the same influence regardless of the location. The concept is first illustrated on numerically simulated data, and then tested on experimental results. In the experiments, full wavefield measurements are obtained using a scanning laser Doppler vibrometer, which allows the measurement of displacements and/or velocities along three axes over a user-defined grid. In the proposed method only out-of-plane velocities are used. Tests performed on simple aluminum and composite plates with artificially introduced longitudinal cracks confirm the effectiveness of the method and its potential for application to the inspection of a variety of structural components. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Statistical pattern recognition methodologies have gained considerable attention for Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) applications to detect changes in a structure (e.g. damage). For most of such applications, outlier analysis of the damage sensitive features obtained from the SHM data is used to detect the changes in the structure. There are a number of different approaches used by different research groups and it is widely accepted that success of a certain methodology may depend on the structure and/or structural change to be identified. Therefore, it is very important that promising methodologies are verified by using different test structures and damage cases. The main objective of this study is to investigate statistical pattern recognition methods in the context of SHM using different laboratory structures. Time series modeling, i.e. auto-regressive models, is used in conjunction with Mahalanobis distance-based outlier detection algorithms to identify different types of structural changes on different test structures. Similar approaches were reported in the literature but here the methodology is modified by using random decrement functions to eliminate the effects of the exogenous input. Then a number of tests are conducted by using two different test structures in laboratory conditions in order to evaluate the results in a comparable fashion. The first test specimen is a simply supported steel beam where the second structure is a highly redundant steel grid structure. Various damage conditions are simulated by using these structures. The ambient vibration data is analyzed by using the methodology described and results are presented. Finally, the advantages and drawbacks of the methodology are discussed in the light of experimental results. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Condition-based maintenance refers to the installation of permanent sensors on a structure/ system. By means of early fault detection, severe damage can be avoided, allowing efficient timing of maintenance works and avoiding unnecessary inspections at the same time. These are the goals for structural health monitoring (SHM). The changes caused by incipient damage on raw data collected by sensors are quite small, and are usually contaminated by noise and varying environmental factors, so the algorithms used to extract information from sensor data need to focus on sensitive damage features. The developments of SHM techniques over the last 20 years have been more related to algorithm improvements than to sensor progress, which essentially have been maintained without major conceptual changes (with regards to accelerometers, piezoelectric wafers, and fiber optic sensors). The main different SHM systems (vibration methods, strain-based fiber optics methods, guided waves, acoustic emission, and nanoparticle-doped resins) are reviewed, and the main issues to be solved are identified. Reliability is the key question, and can only be demonstrated through a probability of detection (POD) analysis. Attention has only been paid to this issue over the last ten years, but now it is a growing trend. Simulation of the SHM system is needed in order to reduce the number of experiments.},

abstract = {Delamination, i.e. the separation between layers that occurs by failure of the resin-rich interlaminar interface, is a direct consequence of the lack of out-of-plane reinforcements and, undoubtedly, the most common damage mode in laminated composites. Delaminations induced by low-velocity impacts are of primary concern in structural applications, since impact damage, often miss-detected, may propagate, impairing the load bearing capacity of the component, particularly under compressive loads. Preventing delamination, as well as delaying and limiting its propagation, are thus key issues in the design of composite structures. Over the last decades, many strategies have been proposed to address this problem. Among them, the introduction of through-thickness reinforcements (stitching, pinning and stapling) has proven to be effective in improving the interlaminar properties of composite materials. In particular, recent studies have shown that Z-pinning, which consists in inserting high stiffness pins through the thickness of uncured laminates, may significantly enhance the delamination resistance of laminated components. In this study, conventional and Z-pin reinforced [02/902]s graphite/epoxy laminates were subjected to low-velocity impact and compression after impact (CAI) tests in order to examine the effect of the reinforcements on the impact response and the residual post-impact properties of the laminate. The results show that Z-pinning significantly reduces the extent of delamination induced by impact, while, on the contrary, it appears to only marginally improve the post-impact compressive strength of the laminates.},

In the this article, we present our studies on Lamb wave propagation characterization and crack detection using a hybrid lead zirconate titanate (PZT)-laser vibrometer system and frequency-wave number analysis. A scanning laser Doppler vibrometer is used to acquiring high-resolution time-space Lamb wavefield excited by a PZT actuator. The recorded wavefield is then transformed to frequency-wave number domain by two-dimensional Fourier transform. Wave spectrum in the frequency-wave number domain shows clear distinction among Lamb wave modes being present. These concepts are illustrated through several experimental tests. However, the space information is lost during this transformation. A short-space two-dimensional Fourier transform is then adopted to obtain the frequency-wave number spectra at various spatial locations, resulting in the space-frequency-wave number representation, which can show how the frequency-wave number component varies with respect to space dimension. It provides a means to study the wave propagation from the perspective of wave number domain. The space-frequency-wave number analysis has successfully been used for the study of wave interaction with structural discontinuity and crack detection on an aluminum plate. {\textcopyright} The Author(s) 2013.},

Moreover, the network is fast. Segmentation of a 512x512 image takes less than a second on a recent GPU.

abstract = {Structural health monitoring has received remarkable attention due to the arising structural safety problems. Most of these structural health problems are accumulative damages such as slight changes in structural deformations which are very hard to be detected. In addition, the complexity of real structure and environmental noises make structural health monitoring more difficult. Existing methods largely use various types of sensors to collect useful parameters and then train a machine learning model to diagnose damage level and location, in which a large amount of training data are needed for the model training, while the labeled data are rare in the real world. To overcome this problem, sparse coding is employed in this paper to achieve structural health monitoring of a bridge equipped with a wireless sensor network, so that a large amount of unlabeled examples can be used to train a feature extractor based on the sparse coding algorithm. Features learned from sparse coding are then used to train a neural network classifier to distinguish different statuses of the bridge. Experimental results show the sparse coding-based deep learning algorithm achieves higher accuracy for structural health monitoring under the same level of environmental noises, compared with some existing methods.},

abstract = {Damage diagnosis has been a challenging inverse problem in structural health monitoring. The main difficulty is characterizing the unknown relation between the measurements and damage patterns (i.e., damage indicator selection). Such damage indicators would ideally be able to identify the existence, location, and severity of damage. Therefore, this procedure requires complex data processing algorithms and dense sensor arrays, which brings computational intensity with it. To address this limitation, this paper introduces convolutional neural network (CNN), which is one of the major breakthroughs in image recognition, to the damage detection and localization problem. The CNN technique has the ability to discover abstract features and complex classifier boundaries that are able to distinguish various attributes of the problem. In this paper, a CNN topology was designed to classify simulated damaged and healthy cases and localize the damage when it exists. The performance of the proposed technique was evaluated through the finite-element simulations of undamaged and damaged structural connections. Samples were trained by using strain distributions as a consequence of various loads with several different crack scenarios. Completely new damage setups were introduced to the model during the testing process. Based on the findings of the proposed study, the damage diagnosis and localization were achieved with high accuracy, robustness, and computational efficiency.},

These IPTs are primarily used to manipulate images to extract defect features, such as cracks in concrete and steel surfaces. However, the extensively varying real-world situations (e.g., lighting and shadow changes) can lead to challenges to the wide adoption of IPTs. To overcome these challenges, this article proposes a vision-based method using a deep architecture of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for detecting concrete cracks without calculating the defect features. As CNNs are capable of learning image features automatically, the proposed method works without the conjugation of IPTs for extracting features. The designed CNN is trained on 40 K images of 256 × 256 pixel resolutions and, consequently, records with about 98% accuracy. The trained CNN is combined with a sliding window technique to scan any image size larger than 256 × 256 pixel resolutions. The robustness and adaptability of the proposed approach are tested on 55 images of 5,888 × 3,584 pixel resolutions taken from a different structure which is not used for training and validation processes under various conditions (e.g., strong light spot, shadows, and very thin cracks). Comparative studies are conducted to examine the performance of the proposed CNN using traditional Canny and Sobel edge detection methods. The results show that the proposed method shows quite better performances and can indeed find concrete cracks in realistic situations.},

abstract = {We introduce Adam, an algorithm for first-order gradient-based optimization of stochastic objective functions, based on adaptive estimates of lower-order moments. The method is straightforward to implement, is computationally efficient, has little memory requirements, is invariant to diagonal rescaling of the gradients, and is well suited for problems that are large in terms of data and/or parameters. The method is also appropriate for non-stationary objectives and problems with very noisy and/or sparse gradients. The hyper-parameters have intuitive interpretations and typically require little tuning. Some connections to related algorithms, on which Adam was inspired, are discussed. We also analyze the theoretical convergence properties of the algorithm and provide a regret bound on the convergence rate that is comparable to the best known results under the online convex optimization framework. Empirical results demonstrate that Adam works well in practice and compares favorably to other stochastic optimization methods. Finally, we discuss AdaMax, a variant of Adam based on the infinity norm.},

abstract = {The strategic and monetary value of the civil infrastructure worldwide necessitates the development of structural health monitoring (SHM) systems that can accurately monitor structural response due to real-time loading conditions, detect damage in the structure, and report the location and nature of this damage. In the last decade, extensive research has been carried out for developing vibration-based damage detection algorithms that can relate structural dynamics changes to damage occurrence in a structure. In the mean time, the wavelet transform (WT), a signal processing technique based on a windowing approach of dilated 'scaled' and shifted wavelets, is being applied to a broad range of engineering applications. Wavelet transform has proven its ability to overcome many of the limitations of the widely used Fourier transform (FT); hence, it has gained popularity as an efficient means of signal processing in SHM systems. This increasing interest in WT for SHM in diverse applications motivates the authors to write an exposition on the current WT technologies. This article presents a utilitarian view of WT and its technologies. By reviewing the state-of-the-art in WT for SHM, the article discusses specific needs of SHM addressed by WT, classifies WT for damage detection into various fields, and describes features unique to WT that lends itself to SHM. The ultimate intent of this article is to provide the readers with a background on the various aspects of WT that might appeal to their need and sector of interest in SHM. Additionally, the comprehensive literature review that comprises this study will provide the interested reader a focused search to investigate using wavelets in SHM.

Differently of typical applications of EMI applied to SHM, which are based on computing the Frequency Response Function (FRF), in this work the procedure is based on the EMI principle but all analysis is conducted directly in time-domain. For this, the PCC are computed from the time response of PZT (Lead Zirconate Titanate) transducers bonded to the monitored structure, which act as actuator and sensor at the same time. The procedure is carried out exciting the PZT transducers using a wide band chirp signal and getting their time responses. The PCC are obtained in both healthy and damaged conditions and used to compute statistics indexes. Tests were carried out on an aircraft aluminum plate and the results have demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed method making it an excellent approach for SHM applications. Finally, the results using EMI signals in both frequency and time responses are obtained and compared. {\textcopyright} The Society for Experimental Mechanics 2014.},

In this paper we investigate the potential mechanisms for this increase through finite element simulations and demonstrate that the shear lag effect through the adhesive is the major source of the signal amplitude difference between the direct and remote bonding cases.},

abstract = {Composite materials are nowadays widely used in several applications, especially in the aerospace field. Despite the numerous advantages that composites can offer, the health monitoring of this type of structures is challenging. A major challenge regards the detection and monitoring of delaminations. In the case of aeronautical structures, delaminations are often caused by impacts with external objects. Therefore, the capability of detection, localization and reconstruction of occurring impacts becomes an essential health monitoring tool for the estimation of the remaining structure lifetime. In this paper, we propose a new procedure for the reconstruction of impacts, based on the structural model and on measured vibration data. The procedure is tested over a carbon fiber reinforced composite plate, instrumented with surface mounted fiber Bragg grating sensors. The experimental results show that the proposed algorithm (VS-LS) can localize and reconstruct the impact forces with at least three times better accuracy than the classical pseudo-inverse method.},

abstract = {In the case of composite structures, low-velocity impact events can cause various types of damage that are mostly hidden inside the laminates or occur on the side opposite to the impact. Thus, damage cannot be easily detected by visual inspection or conventional NDT techniques. Moreover, if the damage occurs between the scheduled inspection periods, the possibilities of extensive damage or catastrophic failure can be increased. For these reasons, built-in NDT systems, such as the real-time impact monitoring system, are required in most composite structures for high reliability and ease of maintenance. In this paper, such an impact monitoring system, including impact location detection and damage assessment techniques, was studied for composite flat and stiffened panels. In order to acquire the impact-induced acoustic signals, four multiplexed fiber Bragg gratings (FBGs) and commercial high-speed FBG interrogator were used. In signal processing for the detection of impact locations and damage occurrences, neural networks and wavelet transforms were adopted. Finally, these algorithms were embodied usingMATLAB and LabVIEW software to obtain a user-friendly interface. {\textcopyright} 2012 Koninklijke Brill NV, Leiden.},

GFRP type C-glass/Epoxy 600 g/m2 and type E-glass/Epoxy 800 g/m2 plates were tested using a single-stage gas gun and drop weight tester. For high-velocity impact, this research investigated the effect of specimen thickness, the type of projectiles, and the impact velocity, whereas for low-velocity impact, this research investigated the effects of specimen thickness based on the number of plies, and impact energy on the failure modes of GFRP type C-glass/Epoxy 600 g/m2 and type E-glass/Epoxy 800 g/m2 using nondestructive testing. The experimental results of the high-velocity impact test showed that both types of GFRP exhibited damage in terms of fiber cracking and fiber pull out, after being tested with four different gas gun pressures. For low-velocity impact tests, the results showed that both types of GFRP exhibited fiber crack and matrix crack. Most of the impacted specimens showed that GFRP type E-glass/Epoxy 800 g/m2 experienced a smaller damage area compared to type C-glass/Epoxy 600 g/m2. From the tests, the effect of the shape of the projectile, the target thickness, the gas gun pressure, and the impact energy on the performance of GFRP were determined. It can be concluded that GFRP type E-glass/Epoxy 800 g/m2 is stronger than GFRP type C-glass/Epoxy 600 g/m2 since it has more fiber volume as it is higher in density and has good mechanical properties. Therefore, GFRP type E-glass/Epoxy 800 g/m2 is recommended to be used in aircraft structure applications.},

abstract = {Guided wave structural health monitoring uses sparse sensor networks embedded in sophisticated structures for defect detection and characterization. The biggest challenge of those sensor networks is developing robust techniques for reliable damage detection under changing environmental and operating conditions (EOC). To address this challenge, we develop a novelty classifier for damage detection based on one class support vector machines. We identify appropriate features for damage detection and introduce a feature aggregation method which quadratically increases the number of available training observations. We adopt a two-level voting scheme by using an ensemble of classifiers and predictions. Each classifier is trained on a different segment of the guided wave signal, and each classifier makes an ensemble of predictions based on a single observation. Using this approach, the classifier can be trained using a small number of baseline signals. We study the performance using Monte-Carlo simulations of an analytical model and data from impact damage experiments on a glass fiber composite plate. We also demonstrate the classifier performance using two types of baseline signals: fixed and rolling baseline training set. The former requires prior knowledge of baseline signals from all EOC, while the latter does not and leverages the fact that EOC vary slowly over time and can be modeled as a Gaussian process.},

abstract = {One of the most important tasks in structural health monitoring corresponds to damage detection. In this task, the existence of damage should be determined. In the literature, several potentially useful techniques for damage detection can be found, and their applicability to a particular situation depends on the size of the critical damages that are admissible in the structure. Almost all of these techniques follow the same general procedure: the structure is excited using actuators, and the dynamical response is sensed at different locations throughout the structure. Any damage will change this vibrational response. The state of the structure is diagnosed by means of the processing of these data. Several studies have shown that the detection of changes in a structure depends on the distance from the damage to the actuator as well as the configuration of the sensor network. In this article, the authors considered the advantage of using an active piezoelectric system, where the lead zirconate titanate transducers are used as actuator and sensors in different actuation phases. In each actuation phase of the diagnosis procedure, one lead zirconate titanate transducer is used as actuator (a known electrical signal is applied), and the others are used as sensors (collecting the wave propagated through the structure at different points). An initial baseline model for undamaged structure is built applying principal component analysis to the data collected by several experiments and after the current structure (damaged or not) is subjected to the same experiments, and the collected data are projected into the principal component analysis models. Two of these projections and four damage indices (T 2-statistic, Q-statistic, combined index, and I 2 index) by each actuation phase are used to determine the presence of damages and to distinguish between them. These indices are calculated based on the analysis of the residual data matrix to represent the variability of the data projected within the residual subspace and the new space of the principal components. To validate the approach, data from two aeronautical structures - an aircraft skin panel and an aircraft turbine blade - are used.},

abstract = {Structural health monitoring using ultrasonic guided waves relies on accurate interpretation of guided wave propagation to distinguish damage state indicators. However, traditional physics based models do not provide an accurate representation, and classic data driven techniques, such as a support vector machine, are too simplistic to capture the complex nature of ultrasonic guide waves. To address this challenge, this paper uses a deep learning interpretation of ultrasonic guided waves to achieve fast, accurate, and automated structural damaged detection. To achieve this, full wavefield scans of thin metal plates are used, half from the undamaged state and half from the damaged state. This data is used to train our deep network to predict the damage state of a plate with 99.98% accuracy given signals from just 10 spatial locations on the plate, as compared to that of a support vector machine (SVM), which achieved a 62% accuracy.},

abstract = {Structural health monitoring (SHM) is usually focused on damage detection (e.g., Yes/No) or approximate estimation of damage size. Any additional details of the damage such as configuration, shape, networking, geometrical statistics, etc., are often either ignored or significantly simplified during SHM characterization. These details, however, can be extremely important for understanding of damage severity and estimations of follow-up damage growth risk. To avoid expensive human participation and/or over-conservative SHM decisions, solutions of computational recognition for damage characterization are needed. Autonomous SHM from visual data is one of the significant challenges in the field of structural prognostics and health monitoring (PHM). The main shortcomings of the image-based PHM algorithms arise from the lack of robustness and fidelity to handle the variability of environment and nature of damage types. In recent times, deep learning has drawn huge amount of traction in the field of machine learning and visual pattern recognition due to its superior performance compared to the state-of-the-art techniques. This paper proposes to formulate and apply a deep learning technique to characterize the damage in the form of cracks on a composite material. The deep learning architecture is constructed by multi-layer neural network that is based on the fundamentals of unsupervised representational learning theory. The robustness and the accuracy of the approach is validated on an extensive set of real image data collected via applying variable load conditions on the structure. The paper has shown a high characterization accuracy over a wide range of loading conditions with limited number of labeled training image data.},

abstract = {Structural health monitoring (SHM) is an important research area, which interest is the damage identification process. Different information about the state of the structure can be obtained in the process, among them, detection, localization and classification of damages are mainly studied in order to avoid unnecessary maintenance procedures in civilian and military structures in several applications. To carry out SHM in prac- tice, two different approaches are used, the first is based on modelling which requires to build a very detailed model of the structure, while the second is by means of data-driven approaches which use information collected from the structure under different struc- tural states and perform an analysis by means of data analysis . For the latter, statisti- cal analysis and pattern recognition have demonstrated its effectiveness in the damage identification process because real information is obtained from the structure through sensors installed permanently to the observed object allowing a real-time monitoring. This chapter describes a damage detection and classification methodology, which makes use of a piezoelectric active system which works in several actuation phases and that is attached to the structure under evaluation, principal component analysis, and machine learning algorithms working as a pattern recognition methodology. In the chapter, the description of the developed approach and the results when it is tested in one aluminum plate are also included. Keywords:},

Yet, these methods require a considerable amount of time to acquire full wavefield data. Therefore, there is a significant need to reduce acquisition time. In this preliminary work, we present a transfer learning approach for reducing the number of sampled measurements necessary. Our method utilizes numerical simula- tions, combined with a small number of spatially sampled random measurements from an experimental structure, to reconstruct full wavefield data. Specifically, we use an autoencoder neural network to learn low-dimensional representations of wave propagation from numerical simulations. We then input a few experimental measurements into the neural network to reconstruct full wave- field data. To demonstrate the ability of our framework, we show our initial success in three scenarios. We show reconstruction accuracies of 86% with one-fourth of the total measurements.},

In this process, the composite model was regularly set down by the circular sensor array, with each sensor acting as an actuator in sequence to generate Lamb waves. Apart from that, other sensors were used to collect response signals. With regard to the damage factor, it was mainly determined by the difference between the damage signal and the non-damage signal. The probabilistic imaging algorithm was employed to carry out damage location imaging. Then, experiments were carried out so as to study the selected composite plate. Finally, the tentative outcomes have illustrated that the maximum error of damage imaging position was 7.07 mm. The relative error was 1.6%. In addition, the method has the characteristics of simple calculation and high imaging efficiency. Therefore, it has large technical potential and wide applications in the damage location and damage recognition for composite material.},

abstract = {Composite materials are heterogeneous in nature and suffer from complex non-linear modes of failure, such as delamination, matrix crack, fiber-breakage, and voids, among others. The early detection of damage in composite structures, such as airplanes, is imperative to avoid catastrophic failure and tragic consequences. This paper reports on the use of machine learning techniques for the damage assessment (i.e., detection, quantification, and localization) of smart composite structures. The success of the machine learning paradigm for damage assessment depends on the representational capability of the discriminative features for the problems of interest. However, from a practical standpoint, it is not possible to define a global or superset of discriminative features that could discriminate between damaged and undamaged states of the structures, and simultaneously make a distinction between various modes of failures. In addition, one machine learning algorithm may show optimum performance for the discriminative features of a particular problem but fails for others. This article focuses on a review of discriminative features and the corresponding machine learning algorithms (both supervised and unsupervised), for various types of damage in smart composite structures.},

Therefore, changes in the physical properties will cause detectable changes in the modal properties. The motivation for the development of this technology is presented. The methods are categorized according to various criteria such as the level of damage detection provided, model-based versus non-model-based methods, and linear versus nonlinear methods. The methods are also described in general terms including difficulties associated with their implementation and their fidelity. Past, current, and future-planned applications of this technology to actual engineering systems are summarized.

abstract = {A method for damage localization based on the phased array idea has been developed. Four arrays of transducers are used to perform a beam-forming procedure. Each array consists of nine transducers placed along a line, which are able to excite and register elastic waves. The A0 Lamb wave mode has been chosen for the localization method. The arrays are placed in such a way that the angular difference between them is 45° and the rotation point is the middle transducer, which is common for all the arrays. The idea has been tested on a square aluminium plate modeled by the Spectral Element Method. Two types of damage were considered, namely distributed damage, which was modeled as stiffness reduction, and cracks, modeled as separation of nodes between selected spectral elements. The plate is excited by a wave packet. The whole array system is placed in the middle of the plate. Each linear phased array in the system acts independently and produces maps of a scanned field based on the beam-forming procedure. These maps are made of time signals (transferred to space domain) that represent the difference between the damaged plate signals and those from the intact plate. An algorithm was developed to join all four maps. The final map is modified by proposed signal processing algorithm to indicate the damaged area of the plate more precisely. The problem for damage localization was investigated and exemplary maps confirming the effectiveness of the proposed system were obtained. It was also shown that the response of the introduced configuration removes the ambiguity of damage localization normally present when a linear phased array is utilized. The investigation is based exclusively on numerical data. {\textcopyright} SAGE Publications 2009.},

The data set acquired from such an array contains time-domain signals from each permutation of transmitter and receiver. A phased addition algorithm is developed that allows an omni-directional, B-scan image of the surrounding plate to be synthesized from any geometry of array. Numerically simulated data from a single reflector is used to test the performance of the algorithm. The results from an array containing a fully populated circular area of elements (Type I array) are found to be good, but those from an array containing a single ring of elements (Type II array) contain many large side-lobes. An enhancement to the basic-phased addition algorithm is presented that uses deconvolution to suppress these side-lobes. The deconvolution algorithm enables a Type II array to equal the performance of a Type I array of the same overall diameter. The effect of diameter on angular resolution is investigated. Experimental data obtained from a guided wave array containing electromagnetic acoustic transducers (EMAT) elements for exciting and detecting the S0 Lamb wave mode in a 5-mm thick aluminium plate are processed with both algorithms and the results are discussed.},

abstract = {Piezoelectric wafer active sensors (PWAS) are inexpensive, non-intrusive un-obtrusive devices that can be surface-mounted on existing structures, or inserted in a new composite structure. The PWAS can be used in both active and passive modes. In active mode, the PWAS generate Lamb waves that can exist as either traveling waves or standing waves. As traveling waves, PWAS-generated Lamb waves can be used with the pitch-catch, pulse-echo, or phased-array methods that arrow far-field and some medium-field damage detection. As standing waves, PWAS-generated Lamb waves can used in conjunction with the electro-mechanical (E/M) impedance technique that allows near field and some medium-field damage detection. This paper presents new results obtained in the use of PWAS for the structural health monitoring of aerospace vehicles. One set of results to be presented will refer to experiments performed on detection the crack propagation in a fracture-mechanics panel with a stress-concentration precrack in the center. The crack was propagated using cyclic fatigue loading in a large testing machine. The crack was imaged with the PWAS EUSR method, which is the guided Lamb wave equivalent of the P-wave C-scan, only that it is produced from a single location and does not need a raster x-y coverage like the conventional P-wave C-scan. PWAS EUSR measurements were taken while the testing machine was running, thus simulating in-service monitoring conditions. Another set of results refers to the PWAS monitoring of disbonds in an spacecraft panel. The E/M impedance technique is shown to distinguish clearly between a bonded and disbonded part. The E/M impedance of bonded part measured at different locations is shown to be consistently the same, with the actual curves overlapping, thus confirming that the impedance changes noticed at the disbonded location are solely due to disbonding.},

abstract = {The Lamb wave-based structural damage detection technique is widely viewed as one of the most encouraging tools for structural health monitoring. However, the propagation of Lamb waves is complicated. Damage-scattering components in the sensing signals may easily be mixed with the waves that come from the source and those reflected from boundaries. Traditionally, damage scattering signals are obtained by comparing test data with a baseline data. However, such a process is affected easily by environmental and operational variability. Major emphases of the research in this article are on developing a baseline-free damage diagnosis technique based on time reversal theory. First, the propagation of the Lamb wave and its time reversal process are discussed. Second, time window functions and improved piezoelectric actuators/sensors array arrangement are developed to separate the scattered signals from the sensing signals. A time reversal imaging method is also adopted to detect and show the damages. This method makes all the scattered signals focus at the corresponding sources so that damages can be revealed. The validity of the proposed method is demonstrated through experiment in which a quasi-isotropic composite plate with PZT array is successfully monitored without relying on any past baseline data.},

abstract = {In this work a problem of damage detection and localization was investigated. A new configuration of piezoelectric transducers was proposed. It consists of twelve transducers. It is in a form of an equilateral triangle that has a 2×2 transducer array in each vertex. Transducers of this configuration were used to excite and register guided waves in an aluminum alloy specimen. Due to known sensitivity of these waves to structural defects it was assumed that registered waves, in the form of voltage signals, carry information about the structure condition. A special algorithm was implemented to process these signals and extract features related to damage. This algorithm transfers information from the time domain to the spatial domain. Results are mapped into coordinate system assigned to monitored structure. In this way in the case of damage present outside or inside the configuration its coordinates are highlighted. In order to detect damage on the direct path between triangle vertices a damage index is defined that indicates whether there is damage present or not. Experimental investigation included three scenarios, one for outside and one for inside localization and one for direct path detection. Results showed that this method has a potential for Structural Health Monitoring of a structure made of an isotropic material. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The combination of an array of distributed transducers permanently coupled to the structure under investigation and the possibility to compare the actual state of the structure with a predefined reference state offers totally new perspectives for elastic wave based signal processing and imaging techniques. In the present paper a multi-level approach for the evaluation of guided elastic wave data obtained by an array of distributed sensors and actuators is presented. For this purpose a numerical simulation platform has been developed that allows extensive 3-D calculations of guided wave propagation including appropriate signal processing and data evaluation algorithms. Calculations in a quasi-isotropic plate are used to exemplary demonstrate various imaging approaches. The results reveal that imaging techniques based on distributed transducer arrays are able to increase the significance of monitoring results and should therefore lead to a considerably better performance and enhanced acceptance of guided wave based SHM systems in the near future.},

The symmetric S0-mode converts continuously into the A0-mode without passing a macroscopic discontinuity.

abstract = {In this work a problem of damage detection and localization was investigated. A new configuration of piezoelectric transducers was proposed. It consists of twelve transducers. It is in a form of an equilateral triangle that has a 2×2 transducer array in each vertex. Transducers of this configuration were used to excite and register guided waves in an aluminum alloy specimen. Due to known sensitivity of these waves to structural defects it was assumed that registered waves, in the form of voltage signals, carry information about the structure condition. A special algorithm was implemented to process these signals and extract features related to damage. This algorithm transfers information from the time domain to the spatial domain. Results are mapped into coordinate system assigned to monitored structure. In this way in the case of damage present outside or inside the configuration its coordinates are highlighted. In order to detect damage on the direct path between triangle vertices a damage index is defined that indicates whether there is damage present or not. Experimental investigation included three scenarios, one for outside and one for inside localization and one for direct path detection. Results showed that this method has a potential for Structural Health Monitoring of a structure made of an isotropic material. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Abstract A rapid, fully non-contact, hybrid system which encompasses an air-coupled transducer (ACT) and a laser Doppler vibrometer (LDV) is presented for profiling A<inf>0</inf> Lamb wave dispersion of an isotropic aluminum plate. The ACT generates ultrasonic pressure incident upon the surface of the plate. The pressure waves are partially refracted into the plate. The LDV is employed to measure the out-of-plane velocity of the excited Lamb wave mode at some distances where the Lamb waves are formed in the plate. The influence of the ACT angle of incidence on Lamb wave excitation is investigated and Snell's law is used to directly compute Lamb wave dispersion curves including phase and group velocity dispersion curves in aluminum plates from incident angles found to generate optimal A<inf>0</inf> Lamb wave mode. The measured curves are compared to results obtained from a two-dimensional (2-D) Fast Fourier transform (FFT), Morlet wavelet transform (MWT) and theoretical predictions. It was concluded that the experimental results obtained using Snell's law concept are well in accordance with the theoretical solutions. The high degree of accuracy in the measured data with the theoretical results proved a high sensitivity of the air-coupled and laser ultrasound in characterizing Lamb wave dispersion in plate-like structures. The proposed non-contact hybrid system can effectively characterize the dispersive relation without knowledge of neither the materials characteristics nor the mathematical model.},

abstract = {A technique for the analysis of full wavefield data in the wavenumber/frequency domain is presented as an effective tool for damage detection, visualization and characterization. Full wavefield data contain a wealth of information regarding the space and time variation of propagating waves in damaged structural components. Such information can be used to evaluate the response spectrum in the frequency/wavenumber domain, which effectively separates incident waves from reflections caused by discontinuities encountered along the wave paths. This allows removing the injected wave from the overall response through simple filtering strategies, thus highlighting the presence of reflections associated to damage. The concept is first illustrated on analytical and numerically simulated data, and then tested on experimental results. In the experiments, full wavefield measurements are conveniently obtained using a Scanning Laser Doppler Vibrometer, which allows the detection of displacements and/or velocities over a user-defined grid, and it is able to provide the required spatial and time information in a timely manner. Tests performed on an aluminum plate with artificially seeded slits simulating longitudinal cracks show the effectiveness of the technique and its potential for application to the inspection of a variety of structural components.},

abstract = {In the area of modal test/analysis/correlation, significant effort has been expended over the past twenty years in order to make reduced models and to expand test data for correlation and eventual updating of the finite element models. This has been restricted by vibration measurements which are traditionally limited to the location of relatively few applied sensors. Advances in computers and digital imaging technology have allowed 3D digital image correlation (DIC) methods to measure the shape and deformation of a vibrating structure. This technique allows for full-field measurement of structural response, thus providing a wealth of simultaneous test data. This paper presents some preliminary results for the test/analysis/correlation of data measured using the DIC approach along with traditional accelerometers and a scanning laser vibrometer for comparison to a finite element model. The results indicate that all three approaches correlated well with the finite element model and provide validation for the DIC approach for full-field vibration measurement.

The proposed model includes the cumulative role of transducer elements (actuator and sensor), substrate structure, and transducer/structure interaction, in the prediction of the full pitch-catch guided wave response under changing temperature. Experimental tests were carried out in a controlled environmental chamber at different temperatures ranging from -40 °C up to 60°C. Time and frequency domain based system responses were obtained. Numerical versus experimental results show that the proposed model is capable of capturing the effect of temperature on PZTs generated/received Lamb waves with great accuracy. In addition, because the SAFE is capable to model also wave propagation in anisotropic plates, the proposed model can lay the groundwork for the development of more robust Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) strategies for complex aerospace structures. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {A number of vibration mode-shape measurement techniques are described in which the measurement point of a laser Doppler vibrometer (LDV) is continuously scanned over the surface of a sinusoidally excited structure. The LDV vibration output is an amplitude-modulated sine wave and mode shapes, defined along the scan line, may therefore be established by demodulation. Alternatively, in the frequency domain, the LDV output is a line spectrum, with sidebands centred on the excitation frequency and spaced at the scan frequency. The sideband amplitudes give series coefficients for the mode shape defined along the scan line - Fourier coefficients for a circular scan or, via a simple transform, polynomial coefficients for a sinusoidal straight line or area scan. Useful measurements can also be made, directed at a single point on a structure: a small-diameter circular scan will give the angular vibration of the structure at the centre of the circle; a conical scan, produced with a short-focus lens, will measure the translational vibration at the point of focus, in magnitude and direction.},

abstract = {The signals acquired by measurements of elastic wave propagation have been used for damage detection since the 1970s. The measurements have been carried out mostly by using piezoelectric transducers of various types. Many different sensor configurations and data processing have been proposed to detect and localise structural defects, both for real-time and off-line testing. Nevertheless, in the last decade, significant progress in the measurement techniques such as scanning laser Doppler vibrometry and shearographic interferometry has been made. These techniques enable measurement of a full wavefield of elastic waves. This opens up new possibilities and solutions for the problems of the damage detection in structures. Many researchers successfully applied this type of measurements for the damage detection and localisation in thin-walled structures. Moreover, advanced signal processing techniques, such as wavenumber filtering, give the possibility of damage size estimation, by filling the gap between damage detection and damage prognosis. The aim of this paper is to give a comprehensive review of methods used for the full wavefield measurement. It also describes and compares selected signal processing algorithms developed for damage detection and visualisation based on these measuring techniques.

The analysis supplies the information on the propagational speeds of dominant signals that are detectable by transducers at various observational points, from which it is possible to locate a source by triangulation.

In damage identification, damage features derived from available input-output and output-only time and frequency data are used to detect, locate, and quantify damage in structural dynamic systems. A new set of damage features and their implementation for damage detection and quantification are discussed in this article. These features are the autoregressive and exogenous coefficients in a frequency domain data model and can be used to distinguish between linear and nonlinear types of damage. In this work, autoregressive coefficients are used to characterize nonlinear damage and exogenous coefficients are used to characterize linear damage states. The ability to distinguish between linear and nonlinear types of damage and healthy system nonlinearities is critical when diagnosing structural health because damage initiation and growth are fundamentally nonlinear processes. It is shown that absolute damage severity can sometimes be determined solely from the degree of linearity-nonlinearity in the system. Experimental data from a three-story building model is analyzed using these features and some important application issues are discussed.},

In diagnostic signal generation, appropriate ultrasonic guided Lamb waves were selected for actuators to maximize receiving sensor measurements. In signal processing, methods were developed to select an individual mode for damage detection and maximize signal to noise ratio in recorded sensor signals. Finally, in damage interpretation, a physics based damage index was developed relating sensor measurements to crack growth size. Fatigue tests were performed on laboratory coupons with a notch to verify the proposed technique. The damage index measured from built-in piezoceramics on the coupons showed a good correlation with the actual fatigue crack growth obtained from visual inspection.

Single mode operation with the lowest order antisymmetric Lamb wave (Ao) mode is achieved in various plates at in agreement with theoretical predictions. The technique is applied for material characterization on single crystal silicon samples and defect detection in composite plates. The phase velocity anisotropy of the Ao mode is measured with signal-to-noise levels exceeding 65 dB. In (111) cut silicon plates the absolute phase velocity is measured with ±0.05% accuracy. The phase velocity anisotropy and effects of delamination in layered composite plates are calculated using the surface impedance approach. The experiments on graphite/epoxy composite plates agree with these calculations and show the potential of the method for defect detection with high resolution. {\textcopyright} 1997 IEEE.},

abstract = {The guided wave (GW) field excited by a wedge-shaped, anisotropic piezocomposite transducer, surface-bonded on an isotropic substrate is investigated with applications to large area structural health monitoring. This investigation supports the development of the composite long-range variable-direction emitting radar (CLoVER) transducer. The analysis is based on the three-dimensional equations of elasticity, and the solution yields expressions for the field variables that are able to capture the multimodal nature of GWs. The assumption of uncoupled dynamics between the actuator and substrate is used, and their interaction is modeled through shear tractions along the transducer's radial edges. A similar problem is modeled using three-dimensional finite element simulations to assess the spatial and transient accuracy of the solution. Experimental tests are also conducted on pristine structures to validate the accuracy of the theoretical approach. The experimental studies employ CLoVER transducers developed in-house, and their manufacturing procedure is briefly described. Frequency response experiments based on piezoelectric sensors are conducted to assess the performance of the solution in the frequency domain. These tests are complemented by laser vibrometer measurements that allow the spatial and temporal evolution of the solution to be evaluated. The numerical simulations and experimental tests show that the wave time of arrival, radial attenuation, and azimuthal distribution are well captured by the theoretical solution. {\textcopyright} 2009 IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract = {This paper provides an overview of methods to detect, locate, and characterize damage in structural and mechanical systems by examining changes in measured vibration response. Research in vibration-based damage identification has been rapidly expanding over the last few years. The basic idea behind this technology is that modal parameters (notably frequencies, mode shapes, and modal damping) are functions of the physical properties of the structure (mass, damping, and stiffness). Therefore, changes in the physical properties will cause detectable changes in the modal properties. The motivation for the development of this technology is presented. The methods are categorized according to various criteria such as the level of damage detection provided, model-based versus non-model-based methods, and linear versus nonlinear methods. The methods are also described in general terms including difficulties associated with their implementation and their fidelity. Past, current, and future-planned applications of this technology to actual engineering systems are summarized. The paper concludes with a discussion of critical issues for future research in the area of vibration-based damage identification.},

abstract = {Vibration-based damage detection (VBDD) comprises a promising set of techniques for damage detection and health monitoring of civil engineering structures. However, the successful application of these methods to real structures is still a challenging task, due primarily to the large size of such structures and the relatively high levels of variability in their dynamic response under operational load conditions. In this paper, a new methodology is introduced for the application of VBDD techniques, with the goal of enhancing their effectiveness for identifying and locating low damage levels and improving their applicability to the continuous or periodic health monitoring of structures. The basic features of the methodology include the use of a controlled and consistent excitation force, the use of operational deflection shapes (ODSs) at all measured frequency increments rather than only at natural frequencies, the use of a logarithmic scale for representing the ODS amplitudes at each frequency increment and the establishment of a threshold level for damage detection that accounts for experimental variability. The performance of the proposed methodology is verified and demonstrated by applying several Level 1 (damage detection) and Level 2 (damage localization) VBDD techniques using experimental data measured on a steel girder taken from a railway bridge. The proposed approach is shown to perform very well at detecting, locating and monitoring the growth of damage. Copyright {\textcopyright} 2011 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

abstract = {Understanding and analysing the complex phenomena related to elastic wave propagation has been the subject of intense research for many years and has enabled application in numerous fields of technology, including structural health monitoring (SHM). In the course of the rapid advancement of diagnostic methods utilising elastic wave propagation, it has become clear that existing methods of elastic wave modeling and analysis are not always very useful; developing numerical methods aimed at modeling and analysing these phenomena has become a necessity. Furthermore, any methods developed need to be verified experimentally, which has become achievable with the advancement of measurement methods utilising laser vibrometry. Guided Waves in Structures for SHM reports on the simulation, analysis and experimental investigation related propagation of elastic waves in isotropic or laminated structures. The full spectrum of theoretical and practical issues associated with propagation of elastic waves is presented and discussed in this one study. Key features: Covers both numerical and experimental aspects of modeling, analysis and measurement of elastic wave propagation in structural elements formed from isotropic or composite materials. Comprehensively discusses the application of the Spectral Finite Element Method for modelling and analysing elastic wave propagation in diverse structural elements. Presents results of experimental measurements employing advanced laser technologies, validating the quality and correctness of the developed numerical models. Accompanying website (www.wiley.com/go/ostachowicz) contains demonstration versions of commercial software developed by the authors for modelling and analyzing elastic wave propagation using the Spectral Finite Element Method. Guided Waves in Structures for SHM provides a state of the art resource for researchers and graduate students in structural health monitoring, signal processing and structural dynamics. This book should also provide a useful reference for practising engineers within structural health monitoring and non-destructive testing. {\textcopyright} 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

The diagnostic system combines a sensor network, portable diagnostic hardware and data analysis software which allows for real-time in situ monitoring and long term tracking of the structural integrity of pressure vessels. Experimental data shows that the system can detect a surface crack as small as 4 mm and a through-crack as small as 2 mm in the high pressure engine pipe made of Inconel 718. It was found that the actuator-sensor paths that are most sensitive to crack growth are the ones in which the crack is growing away from, rather than towards the path. This discovery will provide important guidelines for the design of a sensor network for crack detection. It was also observed that the bending mode (equivalent to the A0 mode in plates) is more sensitive than the longitudinal mode (equivalent to the S0 mode in plates) to crack growth. {\textcopyright} SAGE Publications.},

This paper discusses two independent procedures. The first is based on detecting new strains appearing around a damage spot. The structure does not need to be under loads, the technique is very robust, and damage detectability is high, but it requires sensors to be located very close to the damage, so it is a local technique. The second approach offers wider coverage of the structure; it is based on identifying the changes caused by damage on the strain field in the whole structure for similar external loads. Damage location does not need to be known a priori, and detectability is dependent upon the sensor's network density, the damage size, and the external loads.

Fibre reinforced plastic polymer (FRP) composite materials have been used in the rehabilitation and replacement of the old degrading traditional structures or build new structures. However, the lack of design standards for civil infrastructure limits their structural applications. The majority of the existing applications have been designed based on the research and guidelines provided by the fibre composite manufacturers or based on the designer's experience. It has been a tendency that the final structure is generally over-designed. This paper provides a review on the available studies related to the design optimization of fibre composite structures used in civil engineering such as; plate, beam, box beam, sandwich panel, bridge girder, and bridge deck. Various optimization methods are presented and compared. In addition, the importance of using the appropriate optimization technique is discussed.

However, only 370 questionnaires were only used for this research. Data were analysed using SPSS software 22 version. The findings, ‘knowledge and novelty seeking' were the main push factors that drove long-haul travel by international tourists to Penang. Meanwhile, the main pull factor that attracts long- haul travel by international tourists to Penang was its ‘culture and history'. Additionally, there were partly direct and significant relationships between socio-demographic, trip characteristics and travel motivation (push factors and pull factors). Overall, this study identified the long-haul travel motivations by international tourists to Penang based on socio-demographic, trip characteristics and travel motivation and has indirectly helped in understanding the long-haul travel market particularly for Penang and Southeast Asia. This research also suggested for an effective marketing and promotion strategy in pro- viding useful information that is the key to attract international tourists to travel long distances.

abstract = {Cost-effective and reliable damage detection is critical for the utilization of composite materials. This paper presents part of an experimental and analytical survey of candidate methods for in situ damage detection of composite materials. Experimental results are presented for the application of Lamb wave techniques to quasi-isotropic graphite/epoxy test specimens containing representative damage modes, including delamination, transverse ply cracks and through-holes. Linear wave scans were performed on narrow laminated specimens and sandwich beams with various cores by monitoring the transmitted waves with piezoceramic sensors. Optimal actuator and sensor configurations were devised through experimentation, and various types of driving signal were explored. These experiments provided a procedure capable of easily and accurately determining the time of flight of a Lamb wave pulse between an actuator and sensor. Lamb wave techniques provide more information about damage presence and severity than previously tested methods (frequency response techniques), and provide the possibility of determining damage location due to their local response nature. These methods may prove suitable for structural health monitoring applications since they travel long distances and can be applied with conformable piezoelectric actuators and sensors that require little power.},

@article{Ewald2019,
abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2019 SPIE. In our previous work, we demonstrated how to use inductive bias to infuse a convolutional neural network (CNN) with domain knowledge from fatigue analysis for aircraft visual NDE. We extend this concept to SHM and therefore in this paper, we present a novel framework called DeepSHM which involves data augmentation of captured sensor signals and formalizes a generic method for end-to-end deep learning for SHM. The study case is limited to ultrasonic guided waves SHM. The sensor signal response from a Finite-Element-Model (FEM) is pre-processed through wavelet transform to obtain the wavelet coefficient matrix (WCM), which is then fed into the CNN to be trained to obtain the neural weights. In this paper, we present the results of our investigation on CNN complexities that is needed to model the sensor signals based on simulation and experimental testing within the framework of DeepSHM concept.},

@article{Shelhamer2017,
abstract = {Convolutional networks are powerful visual models that yield hierarchies of features. We show that convolutional networks by themselves, trained end-to-end, pixels-to-pixels, improve on the previous best result in semantic segmentation. Our key insight is to build 'fully convolutional' networks that take input of arbitrary size and produce correspondingly-sized output with efficient inference and learning. We define and detail the space of fully convolutional networks, explain their application to spatially dense prediction tasks, and draw connections to prior models. We adapt contemporary classification networks (AlexNet, the VGG net, and GoogLeNet) into fully convolutional networks and transfer their learned representations by fine-tuning to the segmentation task. We then define a skip architecture that combines semantic information from a deep, coarse layer with appearance information from a shallow, fine layer to produce accurate and detailed segmentations. Our fully convolutional networks achieve improved segmentation of PASCAL VOC (30% relative improvement to 67.2% mean IU on 2012), NYUDv2, SIFT Flow, and PASCAL-Context, while inference takes one tenth of a second for a typical image.},

abstract = {We trained a large, deep convolutional neural network to classify the 1.2 million high-resolution images in the ImageNet LSVRC-2010 contest into the 1000 different classes. On the test data, we achieved top-1 and top-5 error rates of 37.5% and 17.0%, respectively, which is considerably better than the previous state-of-the-art. The neural network, which has 60 million parameters and 650,000 neurons, consists of five convolutional layers, some of which are followed by max-pooling layers, and three fully connected layers with a final 1000-way softmax. To make training faster, we used non-saturating neurons and a very efficient GPU implementation of the convolution operation. To reduce overfitting in the fully connected layers we employed a recently developed regularization method called "dropout" that proved to be very effective. We also entered a variant of this model in the ILSVRC-2012 competition and achieved a winning top-5 test error rate of 15.3%, compared to 26.2% achieved by the second-best entry.},
