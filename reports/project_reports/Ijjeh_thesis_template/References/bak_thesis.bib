  Abstract                 = {The ITTC78 method was originally designed for conventional single screw ships, but has later been modified to adapt twin screw ships and podded propulsors. Nowadays even more unconvensional propulsors are introduced, and the need for a new powering performance method is increasing. This thesis covers the load varying self propulsion method, and looks into how this corresponds to the standard ITTC78 method. The load varying method uses data from a self propusion test only, and uses a predefined increment value to change the revolutions during each run. In this way there are no need for an open water test or a resistance test, and time can be saved. In addition the vessel is tested as a unit, and not broken down into separate pieces like with the ITTC78 method.},

  Abstract                 = {Although some of the earliest attempts to apply mechanical power to the propulsion of ships involved some type of waterjet, it is only in recent years that marine waterjet propulsion has begun to gain acceptance and to challenge the longestablished dominance of the screw propeller. In the last few years there has been a remarkable increase, both in the number of waterjet-propelled vessels, worldwide, and in the number of waterjet manufacturers. These developments seem to fly in the face of accepted theory whereby it has long been taught that waterjets are inherently less efficient than screw propellers. This paper seeks to examine the background and underlying theory of waterjet propulsion which may help to explain the present resurgence of intei'est in this form of propulsion. A review of some leading waterjet propulsor manufacturers' products is presented, with examples of their application. In the course of the paper, many aspects of marine waterjet propulsion technology are touched upon.},

It is based on extensive studies carried out by Professor Bose and his students over the last several years at the Memorial University of Newfoundland, Canada, and his long association with the Institute for Ocean Technology (IOT), National Research Council of Canada. As a result of his International Towing Tank Conference (ITTC) technical committee membership, he has captured the accepted international state-of-the-art of ship powering prediction. Professor Bose has extensively discussed most types of ship propulsors, including oscillating foils and wind-assisted propulsion devices. He has included a general discussion of ship resistance and the prediction of powering performance from model tests, primarily for conventional screw propellers. He has included the problems of screw propellers operating in ice, particularly with regard to strength. He has incorporated extensive lists of references and has included examples to be worked by the reader. As such, the book should be particularly useful to students and those responsible for making powering predictions, especially to those getting started in the field.},

  Abstract                 = {A waterjet propulsion system is used to propel ships, using a pump which produces a high speed jet. A standard waterjet installation can be divided into an inlet, a pump and a nozzle. For manoeuvring and reversing purposes an additional steering device can be integrated into the installation. The development of waterjet propulsion systems has made significant progress over the last few decades. Nowadays, commercial fast-ferries reach velocities of 50 knots, which is about 90 km/h. 
The theory to describe waterjet propulsion systems is derived from open propeller theory. The prediction of the thrust of a propeller is based on the momentum balance of a streamtube control volume. This thrust is then transferred though the shaft of the propeller to the hull of the ship. In contrast, for a waterjet propulsion system, forces are transferred to the hull not only through the shaft but also through the solid surface of the installation. A critical review learns that some assumptions made for open propellers are not valid for waterjets. 
The inflow to the waterjet pump is non-uniform. This results in a blade loading that varies during an impeller revolution. The cause and the effects of this non-uniform inflow have been investigated. Four contributing factors are identified for the development of a non-uniform velocity distribution just upstream of the pump. As a first cause, the water is ingested from below the hull of the ship, where a boundary layer with a non-uniform velocity distribution is present. Even at normal operating conditions, the water is subsequently retarded in the inlet, which results in an increase of the non-uniformity. Finally, the inflow passes the bend in the inlet and the protruding shaft which add to the increase in non-uniformity. It is concluded that the non-uniformity is the result of the accumulated vorticity in the flow. Due to this vorticity, a stable velocity distribution is found, and the typical velocity distribution is more or less independent of the actual design of the inlet. 
The investigations are based on numerical analyses of the flow through the complete waterjet installation. Selection of the numerical method is based on the capability to capture typical flow phenomena in a waterjet installation: high Reynolds number, time-dependency, and incompressible flow in a partially rotating frame of reference. Due to the high level of non-uniformity of the inflow, the ability to generate and transport vorticity in the flow is an important requirement, as well as the possibility to take into account the flow phenomena in the tip clearance region between the rotating blades and the stationary housing. 
A Reynolds averaged Navier-Stokes (BANS) method is chosen to perform all numerical analyses. The Reynolds-stresses are obtained using the two-equation k-[varepsilon] turbulence model. This turbulence model is known to produce an error near a stagnation point. An estimation of the influence of this error on the prediction of thrust and torque shows that the actual deviations are acceptable.},

The study has investigated interaction effects between a waterjet featuring a flush type intake and a planing hull, 7.4 metres in length. Full and model scale resistance and propulsion tests have been conducted to accurately measure the thrust deduction fraction and interaction forces. Various techniques for measuring the waterjet thrust are discussed. Graphs of the thrust deduction fraction for a variety of towing positions are reported. Hull static pressure measurements are also reported. A free body, vector approach was used to develop empirical, analytical models for both the towing and propulsion situations. Both models are based on the Savitsky planing performance equations. The propulsion model draws also on Hadler's work on propeller-hull interaction. The analytical towing model was validated against full scale towing tests and small correction functions added. The adjusted model was found to compare favourably with model tests. Using the correction factors developed for the towing model, an analytical propulsion model is constructed incorporating the waterjet momentum forces. A method is described whereby a vector, called the interaction vector, accounting for remaining interaction effects can be found. Two mechanisms are proposed which would account for the interaction vector. By comparing the full scale propulsion tests with the propulsion model, the interaction vector is found. Its general magnitude and position are shown to be consistent with the combined proposed mechanisms.},

  Abstract                 = {Different from marine propeller designs, which undergo standard stock and design propeller test programmes with detailed assessments of the final design (for the overall propulsive efficiency, the cavitation performance and the pressure fluctuations, etc.), waterjet systems of a final design are seldom tested for their system characteristics, the intake loss and the cavitation performance. It could be both due to economical reasons that waterjet system tests are relatively expensive. It could also be due to technical reasons, such as, that the operating point of a waterjet system does not vary too much for different operational conditions. This means that it performs also very well for all other operational (off-design) conditions once a waterjet system is well-designed for its design condition. However in practice, mismatching of power absorption and shaft rotational rate, and cavitation erosion, are now and then found after the sea trials of the waterjet propelled ships. Remedial action is needed then. In some cases, removing cavitation erosion can be rather difficult and simple modifications may not solve the problem. In order to prevent those kinds of problems from the early 
design stage, waterjet system performance and cavitation tests of the final design are strongly recommended. Taking example of a Fast River Passenger Ferry, test procedures are discussed in detail in the present paper. The scale effects and the extrapolation method are also addressed. The results provide a good data set for CFD validation too.},

Each hull form is shaped to accommodate unique waterjet pump configurations. Waterjet performance evaluation is based on the International Towing Tank Conference's(ITTC 1996) “momentum and energy flux methods.” These flux methods involve analyzing model parameters at six stations throughout the waterjet system, and are used to ultimately predict full scale powering and losses incurred over the waterjet system. Model scale performance parameters at each station can be obtained by traditional experimental practices or computational methods, such as RANS calculations. RANS calculations at certain flow stations within the waterjet system are integrated into experimentally determined powering performance predictions for the entire system. RANS calculations are also used to evaluate assumptions made in experimental practices. RANS full and model scale boundary layers are compared to give further qualitative and quantitative insight into scaling effects. Full scale RANS calculations are also presented and compared to values that are scaled from model scale experimental results. Ultimately, RANS computations predict full scale powering to within two percent of experimentally scaled predictions.},

  Abstract                 = {Numerical simulations of the velocity fields entering the pump of a waterjet propelled ship have been performed to evaluate the level of nonuniformity in axial velocity. Nonuniform axial velocity entering the pump causes unsteady loading of the rotor blades resulting in noise and vibrations, and can increase the risk of rotor cavitation. The hull form modeled in this study is the R/V Athena, fitted with a waterjet propulsion system. Ship speeds correspond to Froude numbers between 0.34 and 0.84 and Reynolds numbers between 3.6 ,\times {\hbox {10}}^{8} and 9.0 ,\times {\hbox {10}}^{8} . The pump flow rate and shaft speed are determined via calm water resistance data from experiments and the pump curves for the axial flow pump. The numerical simulations are for steady, single phase flow and do not include free surface effects. In all of the numerical simulations, the hull draft is constant and the trim angle is fixed at 0 ^{\circ} (even keel). The variation in axial velocity is quantified by total distortion coefficient, harmonic components, and rotor section inflow angles. Using harmonic analysis, it is shown that the nondimensional wake entering the pump exhibits a mean axial velocity component that varies proportionally to nozzle velocity ratio (NVR) and harmonics of constant amplitude and phase, for all ship speeds. Thus, the wake pattern at any ship speed can be approximated using the harmonic content of the wake at one ship speed, and scaling the mean component of axial velocity. It is found that this hull and pump configuration resulted in the pump operating at a fixed pump flow coefficient for all ship speeds simulated. Thus, the average rotor section inflow angles are also constant over the speed range examined, which would be ideal for a rotor with a fixed p- tch distribution as the mean angle of attack on a given rotor section will be independent of ship speed.},

Waterjet as a propulsion system of a vessel is also favorable when it comes to maneuvering, appendage drag, draft and fuel consumption at high speeds. Furthermore, waterjet system has recently gained more credibility for its acceptable efficiency because of the advent of more efficient and large pumps. This type of propulsion system consists of many components working together harmoniously, thus establishing a complex system. A significant problem facing designers when predicting performance of the waterjet is the interaction between the hull and the waterjet. This paper describes the powering performance of a vessel equipped with a waterjet system. The interaction between the hull and waterjet is studied in order to predict the powering characteristics. The work starts with an introduction of the waterjet and a review of its current status in design and analysis. Subsequently, hydrodynamic properties of its components are computed and interactions among them are analyzed. Finally, numerical computation is performed for acquiring pressure distribution by a two dimensional computer code in the suction area of the waterjet inlet to predict the possible occurrence of cavitation for the inlet duct.},

  Abstract                 = {The HSV-2 SWIFT is a 98-meter high-speed catamaran based on the Incat ferry designs. Carderock Division, Naval Surface Warfare Center was tasked by the Naval Sea Systems Command (NAVSEA) to further define the operational powering performance of HSV-2 SWIFT. Standardization Trials were conducted in the Gulf of Mexico off the coast of Ingleside, Texas from 15 to 19 November 2004. The ship was tested at a nominal full load displacement and a nominal light displacement as well as in deep and shallow water. Two and four engine powering combinations were also investigated. The results from Standardization Trials are compared to the results from two previous powering trials completed during
February and May 2004. The first set of trials was conducted off the coast of Honduras at nominal full load displacement and at a lighter displacement. The second set of trials was rough water powering. These trials were conducted in conjunction with seakeeping and structures trials off the coast of Ireland, beginning at a full load displacement and varying down to a light displacement as propulsion fuel was consumed.},

  Abstract                 = {When a ship-owner orders a vessel from a shipyard, a contract is written to confirm and guarantee the agreement for both parts. An important requirement of the contract is the vessel's speed at a given engine power, RPM and draught, in "ideal" conditions (i.e. calm, infinitely deep and current free water, with smooth hull and propeller surfaces at with no wind and zero drift and rudder angle). The speed capacity of the recently built ship is measured carrying out a speed trial. It is rarely possible to perform the trial under ideal, contractual conditions, and the speed will normally be reduced by environmental factors. Whenever the test is carried out in conditions deviating from those contractually specified, the speed must be corrected for, to best coincide with the contractual stipulations. These corrections can be of significant magnitude and are of great economic importance. Penalties of considerable size are given to shipyards that fail to deliver in accordance with the contract. There are various standards published providing guidelines regarding the execution of speed trials, the measurements that are to be performed during the trials and corrections for environmental factors that are to be made in retrospect. ISO (2002), Perdon (2002), Bose (2005) and B. Henk (2006) were chosen for evaluation and comparison in this thesis. The recommendations of the standards are occasionally disagreeing.The main resistance contribution is claimed to be wind and wave (Bose (2005) and B. Henk (2006)). B. Henk (2006)) states; "these corrections (small displacement deviations, shallow water, and salinity deviations) are relatively small compared to wind and wave directions". Reinertsen (2011) suspects that the added wave resistances calculated by the Hyundai shipyard are too large. This assumption is based on Haugan (2011)'s (employee of KGJS) mean wave load calculations that generally gave results 30 % lower than those found by Hyundai. An unrealistically large correction factor for wave resistance is most definitely advantageous for the shipyard. This will give a higher calculated contractual speed, and the shipyard is consequently more likely to meet the contractual requirements. The Hyundai shipyard's correction procedures were evaluated based on the relevant standards. The shipyard neglects all resistance components, but the added resistance due to wind and waves (they also correct for large discrepancies between the trim/draught obtained at speed trial and that contractually stipulated. This is however not relevant for tankers, as these generally are capable of achieving design draught at the sea trial). This is consistent with the recommendations of Perdon (2002) and B. Henk (2006). The shipyard does not have the speed trials conducted in head - or following waves, nor head - or following wind. B. Henk (2006) and Perdon (2002) underline the importance of executing the speed trials in head - or following waves. Perdon (2002) argues; "in the case when the waves do not come from the bow or the stern the correction methods are not sufficiently reliable and the effects of steering and drift on the ship's performance may be underestimated". ISO (2002) recommends performing the trials in head and following wind (note that there usually is a correlation between true wind - and wave direction).The Hyundai shipyard assumes that the wave direction with respect to the ship's centerline equals the relative wind angle. This conflicts with the recommendations of the standards. They advise to obtain the wave direction by visual observations or instruments such as buoys or sea wave analysis radars. Furthermore, Hyundai's assumption is highly illogical from a scientific standpoint. In this thesis, the added wave resistance (due to diffraction) was computed by a handful of methods proposed in the literature. The computed values obtained in this report were all substantially larger than those found by Hyundai. This denies Reinertsen (2011)'s suspicion of Hyundai's correction factors for wave resistance being unrealistically high. B. Henk (2006) emphasizes the importance of accounting for the location of the anemometer in the computations of added resistance due to wind. This is not done by the shipyard. B. Henk (2006) proposes a formula for correction of improper placements of the anemometer. In this thesis, the added wind resistance was calculated, including this correction. The added resistance found was 28 % smaller than the value obtained by Hyundai. This is relevant as the wind tends to be a key resistance contribution.Finally, the Energy Efficiency Design Index (EEDI) has been described. The EEDI estimates a ship's CO2 emission per ton-mile of goods transported; put differently, the vessel's impact on the environment in relation to its benefit for society. The EEDI is to be implemented for all new ships, 1st of January 2013. The value of this index will be determined based on results from speed trials.},

On both sides of the Atlantic major increases in model resistance have been measured due to the use of turbulence stimulators, and it has become clear that turbulent boundary layer flow must be stimulated from as near the stem as possible if correct comparison is to be made between one design and another. This conclusion assumes that the flow on the ship is entirely turbulent, and that the basis of friction comparison between model and ship is a fully turbulent friction coefficient. The question of a fully turbulent friction coefficient is one for discussion at the forthcoming International Towing Tank Conference, but it is not intended to develop that side of the subject in this paper.},

The ITTC Waterjet Performance Prediction Specialist Committee was active in the 21st (Hoyt 1999), 22nd (Van Terwisga 2002), and 23rd (Van Terwisga 2005) ITTC committee period tasked with developing a model testing procedure for waterjet propulsion. It has been generally accepted that conventional shaft dynamometer propulsion tests are not suitable due to scale effects on pump performance, and often the use of surrogate model pumps. The committee adopted a control volume approach balancing momentum and energy through the waterjet system to arrive at system thrust,
thrust deduction, and delivered power. From assumptions made for the full scale pump efficiency, and inflow wake scaling, a prediction of full scale delivered power can be made. The committee identified areas of largest uncertainty as the accurate measure of the pump mass flow due to flow nonuniformity in the exhaust nozzles, the measure of hull resistance, and the establishment of the proper tow force. The ITTC standard locations for the flow through the waterjet are indicated in Figure 1. The inflow capture area is designated as Station 1(1a), one pump diameter ahead of the inlet tangency. Station 3 is located just ahead of the pump, and Station 6 is at the nozzle discharge.},

The current study focuses on validation of detailed duct flow simulations on catamarans using the Delft catamaran as the model. The validation work is conducted as a pre-requisite for subsequent URANS based optimization. The Delft catamaran model was build at BSHC and a customized waterjet was designed for the model based on pre-existing stock waterjet designs. Data from the model testing using the ITTC '05 procedures include net jet thrust, thrustdeduction, water-jet volume flow-rate, sinkage, trim, and jet velocity surveys at nozzle exit. Simulations were performed over a speed range of 0.4<Fr<0.75 using URANS and an actuator disk body-force model. The computed net jet thrust, thrust deduction, sinkage and trim compare well with 
experiments indicating that the present approach is an efficient tool to predict the performance of waterjet propelled JHSS and paves way for future optimization work.},

This volume contains a completely new presentation of the subject of ship resistance embodying these developments. A major goal in the design of virtually all vessels is to obtain a hull form having low resistance. In achieving this goal, the accurate prediction of resistance for a given hull geometry is essential. Since the publication of the previous edition of PNA important advances have been made in theoretical and computational fluid dynamics accompanied by increased use of such work in ship and offshore structure design. The first section of the book provides basic understanding of the flow phenomena that underlie the resistance encountered by a ship moving in water. The second section contains an introduction to the methods by which that knowledge is applied to the prediction of resistance, including model testing, empirical methods and computational methods. A final section provides guidance to the naval architect in designing a hull form. Design procedures are described for achieving favorable flow and resistance characteristics of the hull and appendages. Examples are given for ships designed for high, medium and low speeds. Design considerations affecting both wave and viscous effects are included. Finally the flow in the stern wake is discussed, an area important for both resistance and propeller performance.},

Various towing-tank techniques have also been used for the same purpose of predicting the wave-making resistance of a full size ship. This paper presents a novel technique to predict the effects of demihull spacing on the wave-making resistance of a catamaran by testing one of its demihulls in close proximity to a towing tank wall, The tank wall acts as the plane of symmetry of the catamaran, reflecting waves generated by the demihull, and thereby provides the correct wave interference and blockage effects from the non-existent hull. A series of model tests on a catamaran and an equivalent-demihull was the subject of the experimental testing. Hull spacing-to-model-length ratios of 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, and 0.5, were tested over a range of speeds in two water depths and two tank widths. A large number of experimental results and theoretical computations have been made to examine the hypothesis of testing half of the catamaran, and it is shown that the demihull approach can be used to accurately predict the influence of the catamaran hull spacing. },

This expression fits model data without bias and, unlike any other extrapolator, provides an estimate of the hydraulically smooth Lucy Ashton which is quantitatively consistent with the actual ship data. Use of an expression of k in terms of block coefficient, length/displacement ratio, and U-ness of stern is shown to be potentially capable of estimating smooth ship resistances to within +3 percent for forms with bulbous bows as well as for forms without.},

  Abstract                 = {In the last decade, waterjet propulsors have found increasing acceptance as an alternative to marine screws and other propeller types. Over the same interval, waterjets have evolved from relatively small, simple propulsors for small recreational craft, to sophisticated engineering systems appropriate for high speed and high power vessels. The continuing development of propulsors for such vessels is aided by research for improvement and evaluation of designs. The development of research capabilities in this field is in progress at the Institute for Marine Dynamics. It has been focusing on the ability to perform experiments of vessels and their propulsors at model scale in order to evaluate the performance of the integrated system. -- Model testing techniques for waterjet propelled craft are reviewed and discussed from various relevant works on the subject. Several types of waterjet propulsors as well as some of the common vessel types are identified with respect to the scope of the testing capabilities of the facility. Two phases of experiments were prepared for a model of a 12 metre recreational craft with simple model jets. The phases consisted of bare hull resistance tests and self-propulsion tests. The experiments were intended as trials for testing techniques and instrumentation since results could be compared with the full scale performance of the vessel. One conclusion drawn from the tests was that a model waterjet propulsor would have to be designed and instrumented specifically for such experiments. -- An experimental waterjet propulsor test platform was then developed to accommodate the requirements derived from the initial test phases. The platform housed a model which employed a modular design allowing variation of internal geometry of the waterjet design if required. The platform was fully instrumented to measure flow speeds and pressures in the nozzle and near the impeller. A transparent impeller region was designed to observe possible cavitation phenomena. Thrust, torque, shaft speed and volume flow rate were also measured. The design, instrumentation, test program and test results of the model waterjet and platform are presented and discussed.},

The main purpose is to provide background information for a discussion on the necessity of additional data for the development of reliable simulation models that are able to describe a ship's manoeuvring behaviour in (very) shallow and restricted navigation areas in a realistic way.},
