abstract = {A theory formulated in 1916 by Horace Lamb predicting that plates may vibrate in up to an infinite number of modes is confirmed by a method described. The theory is extended to correlate experimental observations. Equations are developed relating phase velocity to frequency and plate thickness in terms of longitudinal and shear wave velocity. Families of curves are obtained for aluminum and zirconium. The distinguishing characteristics of the various modes are discussed in the light of potential nondestructive testing applications. It is shown that the interior particles are displaced in elliptical orbits, with vertical motions existing at the surfaces when the wave velocity is (2) 1/2 shear wave velocity, and horizontal surface motions existing for wave velocities equal to longitudinal wave velocity. {\textcopyright} 1961 The American Institute of Physics.},

abstract = {This article summarizes the underlying principles and basic theories for the source location, source mechanism, signal dispersion and source characterization of acoustic emission. The sources can be represented by a variety of dynamic nuclei of strains based on the theory of elastic waves. The dispersion of signals radiated by these sources in a wave guide such as a thick plate or a thick walled cylinder is analyzed by applying the theory of generalized ray, and the theory of normal modes. The analysis supplies the information on the propagational speeds of dominant signals that are detectable by transducers at various observational points, from which it is possible to locate a source by triangulation. It also provides a rational basis to determine the kinetic and kinematic characterists of a source through deconvolution and other semi-inverse procedures. Relations of acoustic emission, to microseismic activity, and seismology are also discussed.},

abstract = {A neural network model for a mechanism of visual pattern recognition is proposed in this paper. The network is self-organized by "learning without a teacher", and acquires an ability to recognize stimulus patterns based on the geometrical similarity (Gestalt) of their shapes without affected by their positions. This network is given a nickname "neocognitron". After completion of self-organization, the network has a structure similar to the hierarchy model of the visual nervous system proposed by Hubel and Wiesel. The network consits of an input layer (photoreceptor array) followed by a cascade connection of a number of modular structures, each of which is composed of two layers of cells connected in a cascade. The first layer of each module consists of "S-cells", which show characteristics similar to simple cells or lower order hypercomplex cells, and the second layer consists of "C-cells" similar to complex cells or higher order hypercomplex cells. The afferent synapses to each S-cell have plasticity and are modifiable. The network has an ability of unsupervised learning: We do not need any "teacher" during the process of self-organization, and it is only needed to present a set of stimulus patterns repeatedly to the input layer of the network. The network has been simulated on a digital computer. After repetitive presentation of a set of stimulus patterns, each stimulus pattern has become to elicit an output only from one of the C-cell of the last layer, and conversely, this C-cell has become selectively responsive only to that stimulus pattern. That is, none of the C-cells of the last layer responds to more than one stimulus pattern. The response of the C-cells of the last layer is not affected by the pattern's position at all. Neither is it affected by a small change in shape nor in size of the stimulus pattern. {\textcopyright} 1980 Springer-Verlag.},

Compared with other decision tree induction techniques that are based upon recursive partitioning employing greedy searches to choose the best splitting attribute and value at each node that will necessarily miss regions of the search space, the genetic programming based approach can overcome the problem. However, the method still requires the discretization of the often continuous-valued toxicity endpoints prior to the tree induction. A novel extension of this method, YAdapt, is introduced in this work which models the original continuous endpoint by adaptively finding suitable ranges to describe the endpoints during the tree induction process, removing the need for discretization prior to tree induction and allowing the ordinal nature of the endpoint to be taken into account in the models built.},

At the core of backpropagation is a method for calculating derivatives exactly and efficiently in any large system made up of elementary subsystems or calculations which are represented by known, differentiable functions; thus, backpropagation has many applications which do not involve neural networks as such. This paper first reviews basic backpropagation, a simple method which is now being widely used in areas like pattern recognition and fault diagnosis. Next, it presents the basic equations for back-propagation through time, and discusses applications to areas like pattern recognition involving dynamic systems, systems identification, and control. Finally, it describes further extensions of this method, to deal with systems other than neural networks, systems involving simultaneous equations or true recurrent networks, and other practical issues which arise with this method. Pseudocode is provided to clarify the algorithms. The chain rule forordered derivatives—the theorem which underlies backpropagation—is briefly discussed. {\textcopyright} 1990, IEEE},

abstract = {Learning to store information over extended time intervals by recurrent backpropagation takes a very long time, mostly because of insufficient, decaying error backflow. We briefly review Hochreiter's (1991) analysis of this problem, then address it by introducing a novel, efficient, gradient based method called long short-term memory (LSTM). Truncating the gradient where this does not do harm, LSTM can learn to bridge minimal time lags in excess of 1000 discrete-time steps by enforcing constant error flow through constant error carousels within special units. Multiplicative gate units learn to open and close access to the constant error flow. LSTM is local in space and time; its computational complexity per time step and weight is O. 1. Our experiments with artificial data involve local, distributed, real-valued, and noisy pattern representations. In comparisons with real-time recurrent learning, back propagation through time, recurrent cascade correlation, Elman nets, and neural sequence chunking, LSTM leads to many more successful runs, and learns much faster. LSTM also solves complex, artificial long-time-lag tasks that have never been solved by previous recurrent network algorithms.},

Single mode operation with the lowest order antisymmetric Lamb wave (Ao) mode is achieved in various plates at in agreement with theoretical predictions. The technique is applied for material characterization on single crystal silicon samples and defect detection in composite plates. The phase velocity anisotropy of the Ao mode is measured with signal-to-noise levels exceeding 65 dB. In (111) cut silicon plates the absolute phase velocity is measured with ±0.05% accuracy. The phase velocity anisotropy and effects of delamination in layered composite plates are calculated using the surface impedance approach. The experiments on graphite/epoxy composite plates agree with these calculations and show the potential of the method for defect detection with high resolution. {\textcopyright} 1997 IEEE.},

A direct, fast and inexpensive method is therefore required to evaluate and localize damage using the change in dynamic parameters between the intact and damage states. This paper investigates the application of the change in modal curvatures to detect damage in a prestressed concrete bridge. To establish the method simply supported and continuous beams containing damaged parts at different locations are tested using simulated data. Some important conclusions concerning the computation of the modal curvatures are drawn. A damage indicator called "curvature damage factor" is introduced, in which the difference in curvature mode shape for all modes can be summarized in one number for each measured point. The technique is further applied to a real structure, namely bridge Z24 which lies between the villages Koppigen and Utzenstorf and crosses the highway A1 between Bern and Zurich in Switzerland. In the framework of a Brite-Euram project, the bridge is used as a full-scale specimen and subjected to different damage scenarios in order to introduce damage. {\textcopyright} 1999 Academic Press.},

Alternatively, in the frequency domain, the LDV output is a line spectrum, with sidebands centred on the excitation frequency and spaced at the scan frequency. The sideband amplitudes give series coefficients for the mode shape defined along the scan line - Fourier coefficients for a circular scan or, via a simple transform, polynomial coefficients for a sinusoidal straight line or area scan. Useful measurements can also be made, directed at a single point on a structure: a small-diameter circular scan will give the angular vibration of the structure at the centre of the circle; a conical scan, produced with a short-focus lens, will measure the translational vibration at the point of focus, in magnitude and direction.},

This presentation will summarize the outcome of an updated review covering the years 1996-2001. The updated review follows the LANL statistical pattern recognition paradigm for SHM, which addresses four topics: 1. Operational Evaluation; 2. Data Acquisition and Cleansing; 3. Feature Extraction; and 4. Statistical Modeling for Feature Discrimination. The literature has been reviewed based on how a particular study addresses these four topics. A significant observation from this review is that although there are many more SHM studies being reported, the investigators, in general, have not yet fully embraced the well-developed tools from statistical pattern recognition. As such, the discrimination procedures employed are often lacking the appropriate rigor necessary for this technology to evolve beyond demonstration problems carried out in laboratory setting.},

Therefore, the ability to monitor the structural health of these systems is becoming increasingly important. A wide variety of highly effective local non-destructive evaluation tools is available. However, damage identification based upon changes in vibration characteristics is one of the few methods that monitor changes in the structure on a global basis. A summary of developments in the field of global structural health monitoring that have taken place over the last thirty years is first presented. Vibration-based damage detection is a primary tool that is employed for this monitoring. Next, the process of vibration-based damage detection will be described as a problem in statistical pattern recognition. This process is composed of three portions: (i) data acquisition and cleansing; (ii) feature selection and data compression; and (iii) statistical model development. Current research regarding feature selection and statistical model development will be emphasized with the application of this technology to a large-scale laboratory structure.},

This paper presents part of an experimental and analytical survey of candidate methods for in situ damage detection of composite materials. Experimental results are presented for the application of Lamb wave techniques to quasi-isotropic graphite/epoxy test specimens containing representative damage modes, including delamination, transverse ply cracks and through-holes. Linear wave scans were performed on narrow laminated specimens and sandwich beams with various cores by monitoring the transmitted waves with piezoceramic sensors. Optimal actuator and sensor configurations were devised through experimentation, and various types of driving signal were explored. These experiments provided a procedure capable of easily and accurately determining the time of flight of a Lamb wave pulse between an actuator and sensor. Lamb wave techniques provide more information about damage presence and severity than previously tested methods (frequency response techniques), and provide the possibility of determining damage location due to their local response nature. These methods may prove suitable for structural health monitoring applications since they travel long distances and can be applied with conformable piezoelectric actuators and sensors that require little power.},

It includes core material, current research and a wide range of applications. Its length is nearly double that of the first edition. Researchers in statistics, or in other fields that use principal component analysis, will find that the book gives an authoritative yet accessible account of the subject. It is also a valuable resource for graduate courses in multivariate analysis. The book requires some knowledge of matrix algebra.

In damage identification, damage features derived from available input-output and output-only time and frequency data are used to detect, locate, and quantify damage in structural dynamic systems. A new set of damage features and their implementation for damage detection and quantification are discussed in this article. These features are the autoregressive and exogenous coefficients in a frequency domain data model and can be used to distinguish between linear and nonlinear types of damage. In this work, autoregressive coefficients are used to characterize nonlinear damage and exogenous coefficients are used to characterize linear damage states. The ability to distinguish between linear and nonlinear types of damage and healthy system nonlinearities is critical when diagnosing structural health because damage initiation and growth are fundamentally nonlinear processes. It is shown that absolute damage severity can sometimes be determined solely from the degree of linearity-nonlinearity in the system. Experimental data from a three-story building model is analyzed using these features and some important application issues are discussed.},

The data set acquired from such an array contains time-domain signals from each permutation of transmitter and receiver. A phased addition algorithm is developed that allows an omni-directional, B-scan image of the surrounding plate to be synthesized from any geometry of array. Numerically simulated data from a single reflector is used to test the performance of the algorithm. The results from an array containing a fully populated circular area of elements (Type I array) are found to be good, but those from an array containing a single ring of elements (Type II array) contain many large side-lobes. An enhancement to the basic-phased addition algorithm is presented that uses deconvolution to suppress these side-lobes. The deconvolution algorithm enables a Type II array to equal the performance of a Type I array of the same overall diameter. The effect of diameter on angular resolution is investigated. Experimental data obtained from a guided wave array containing electromagnetic acoustic transducers (EMAT) elements for exciting and detecting the S0 Lamb wave mode in a 5-mm thick aluminium plate are processed with both algorithms and the results are discussed.},

It consists of three major components: diagnostic signal generation, signal processing and damage interpretation. In diagnostic signal generation, appropriate ultrasonic guided Lamb waves were selected for actuators to maximize receiving sensor measurements. In signal processing, methods were developed to select an individual mode for damage detection and maximize signal to noise ratio in recorded sensor signals. Finally, in damage interpretation, a physics based damage index was developed relating sensor measurements to crack growth size. Fatigue tests were performed on laboratory coupons with a notch to verify the proposed technique. The damage index measured from built-in piezoceramics on the coupons showed a good correlation with the actual fatigue crack growth obtained from visual inspection. Furthermore, parametric studies were also performed to characterize the sensitivity of sensor/actuator location for the proposed technique.},

Experimental data shows that the system can detect a surface crack as small as 4 mm and a through-crack as small as 2 mm in the high pressure engine pipe made of Inconel 718. It was found that the actuator-sensor paths that are most sensitive to crack growth are the ones in which the crack is growing away from, rather than towards the path. This discovery will provide important guidelines for the design of a sensor network for crack detection. It was also observed that the bending mode (equivalent to the A0 mode in plates) is more sensitive than the longitudinal mode (equivalent to the S0 mode in plates) to crack growth. {\textcopyright} SAGE Publications.},

abstract = {The strategic and monetary value of the civil infrastructure worldwide necessitates the development of structural health monitoring (SHM) systems that can accurately monitor structural response due to real-time loading conditions, detect damage in the structure, and report the location and nature of this damage. In the last decade, extensive research has been carried out for developing vibration-based damage detection algorithms that can relate structural dynamics changes to damage occurrence in a structure. In the mean time, the wavelet transform (WT), a signal processing technique based on a windowing approach of dilated 'scaled' and shifted wavelets, is being applied to a broad range of engineering applications. Wavelet transform has proven its ability to overcome many of the limitations of the widely used Fourier transform (FT); hence, it has gained popularity as an efficient means of signal processing in SHM systems. This increasing interest in WT for SHM in diverse applications motivates the authors to write an exposition on the current WT technologies. This article presents a utilitarian view of WT and its technologies. By reviewing the state-of-the-art in WT for SHM, the article discusses specific needs of SHM addressed by WT, classifies WT for damage detection into various fields, and describes features unique to WT that lends itself to SHM. The ultimate intent of this article is to provide the readers with a background on the various aspects of WT that might appeal to their need and sector of interest in SHM. Additionally, the comprehensive literature review that comprises this study will provide the interested reader a focused search to investigate using wavelets in SHM.

abstract = {In this paper some usual vibration-based damage identification techniques (VBDIT) will be reviewed and used for structural damage evaluation. With the help of a simple supported beam with different damage levels the reliability of these techniques will be investigated. The techniques reviewed herein are based on measured modal parameters which use only few mode shapes and/or modal frequencies of the structure that can be easily obtained by dynamic tests. In other words, by realizing two sets of dynamic measurements, corresponding to two moments of the structure lifetime, the dynamic modal parameters can be obtained. In order to assess properly the performance of these techniques different noise levels are randomly introduced to the response signals of a simulated beam which is exited by a random force. For different levels of damage and noise, the probabilities of damage detection and the probabilities of false alarm for the total number of simulations is evaluated. It can be concluded that among the evaluated techniques the strain energy method presents the best stability regarding noisy signals; however, the detection judgement depends on a threshold level which is discussed in this paper. The change in mode shape curvature, change in flexibility and change in flexibility curvature methods are also capable to detect and localise damaged elements but in the case of complex and simultaneous damages these techniques show less efficiency. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Signal processing algorithms for guided wave pulse echo-based SHM must be capable of isolating individual reflections from defects in the structure, if any, which could be overlapping and multimodal. In addition, they should be able to estimate the time-frequency centers, the modes and individual energies of the reflections, which would be used to locate and characterize defects. Finally, they should be computationally efficient and amenable to automated processing. This work addresses these issues with a new algorithm employing chirplet matching pursuits followed by a mode correlation check for single point sensors. Its theoretical advantages over conventional time-frequency representations in all aspects are elaborated and these are demonstrated using numerical simulations and experiments in isotropic plate structures. The issue of in-plane triangulation is then discussed and experimental work done to explore this issue is presented. This work concludes with a description of how the algorithm can be extended to composite plate structures.},

This paper demonstrates that the technology is capable of detecting material loss on real aircraft components using embedded piezoelectric sensors on hidden surfaces. The work is novel in more than one respect. Firstly, it demonstrates that Lamb wave ultrasonic tomography can be used to accurately map material loss on an exposed aircraft surface with sensors embedded on the structure's hidden surface. Hidden, in this case, refers to the surface that is not exposed to the atmosphere - the underneath of an aircraft wing, for example. Secondly, it compares tomographic images generated by fan-beam back projection and the signal difference coefficient methods, showing clearly that the latter are more sensitive to material loss. {\textcopyright} 2006 IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract = {Piezoelectric wafer active sensors (PWAS) are inexpensive, non-intrusive un-obtrusive devices that can be surface-mounted on existing structures, or inserted in a new composite structure. The PWAS can be used in both active and passive modes. In active mode, the PWAS generate Lamb waves that can exist as either traveling waves or standing waves. As traveling waves, PWAS-generated Lamb waves can be used with the pitch-catch, pulse-echo, or phased-array methods that arrow far-field and some medium-field damage detection. As standing waves, PWAS-generated Lamb waves can used in conjunction with the electro-mechanical (E/M) impedance technique that allows near field and some medium-field damage detection. This paper presents new results obtained in the use of PWAS for the structural health monitoring of aerospace vehicles. One set of results to be presented will refer to experiments performed on detection the crack propagation in a fracture-mechanics panel with a stress-concentration precrack in the center. The crack was propagated using cyclic fatigue loading in a large testing machine. The crack was imaged with the PWAS EUSR method, which is the guided Lamb wave equivalent of the P-wave C-scan, only that it is produced from a single location and does not need a raster x-y coverage like the conventional P-wave C-scan. PWAS EUSR measurements were taken while the testing machine was running, thus simulating in-service monitoring conditions. Another set of results refers to the PWAS monitoring of disbonds in an spacecraft panel. The E/M impedance technique is shown to distinguish clearly between a bonded and disbonded part. The E/M impedance of bonded part measured at different locations is shown to be consistently the same, with the actual curves overlapping, thus confirming that the impedance changes noticed at the disbonded location are solely due to disbonding.},

The need to be able to detect damage in complex structures has led to the development of a vast range of techniques, of which many are based upon structural vibration analysis. In the present article, some of the latest advances in Structural Health Monitoring and Damage Detection are reviewed, with an emphasis on composite structures on the grounds that this class of materials currently has a wide range of engineering applications. FOREWORD-It should be noted that this review is not intended to be a general, all-encompassing review covering the whole range of structural health monitoring (SHM); it was planned as the starting point for a study focusing on damage detection, localization and assessment for certain kinds of structure. Thus, the line of thought behind the search and the structure of this review is a result of objectives beyond the scope of the paper itself. Nevertheless, it was considered that, once the above was understood, an updated synopsis such as this could also be useful for other researchers in the same field. {\textcopyright}2006 SAGE Publications.},

abstract = {Structural health monitoring (SHM) using guided waves is one of the only ways in which damage anywhere in a structure can be detected using a sparse array of permanently attached sensors. To distinguish damage from structural features, some form of comparison with damage-free reference data is essential, and here subtraction is considered. The detectability of damage is determined by the amplitude of residual signals from structural features remaining after the subtraction of reference data. These are non-zero due to changing environmental conditions such as temperature. In this paper, the amplitude of the residual signals is quantified for different guided-wave SHM strategies. Comparisons are made between two methods of reference signal subtraction and between two candidate sensor configurations. These studies allow estimates to be made of the number of sensors required per unit area to reliably detect a prescribed type of damage. It is shown that the number required is prohibitively high, even in the presence of modest temperature fluctuations, hence some form of temperature compensation is absolutely essential for guided-wave SHM systems to be viable. A potential solution is examined and shown to provide an improvement in signal suppression of approximately 30dB, which corresponds to two orders of magnitude reduction in the number of sensors required. {\textcopyright}2007 The Royal Society.},

abstract = {In broad terms, there are two approaches to damage identification. Model-driven methods establish a high-fidelity physical model of the structure, usually by finite element analysis, and then establish a comparison metric between the model and the measured data from the real structure. If the model is for a system or structure in normal (i.e. undamaged) condition, any departures indicate that the structure has deviated from normal condition and damage is inferred. Data-driven approaches also establish a model, but this is usually a statistical representation of the system, e.g. a probability density function of the normal condition. Departures from normality are then signalled by measured data appearing in regions of very low density. The algorithms that have been developed over the years for data-driven approaches are mainly drawn from the discipline of pattern recognition, or more broadly, machine learning. The object of this paper is to illustrate the utility of the data-driven approach to damage identification by means of a number of case studies.},

abstract = {A technique for the analysis of full wavefield data in the wavenumber/frequency domain is presented as an effective tool for damage detection, visualization and characterization. Full wavefield data contain a wealth of information regarding the space and time variation of propagating waves in damaged structural components. Such information can be used to evaluate the response spectrum in the frequency/wavenumber domain, which effectively separates incident waves from reflections caused by discontinuities encountered along the wave paths. This allows removing the injected wave from the overall response through simple filtering strategies, thus highlighting the presence of reflections associated to damage. The concept is first illustrated on analytical and numerically simulated data, and then tested on experimental results. In the experiments, full wavefield measurements are conveniently obtained using a Scanning Laser Doppler Vibrometer, which allows the detection of displacements and/or velocities over a user-defined grid, and it is able to provide the required spatial and time information in a timely manner. Tests performed on an aluminum plate with artificially seeded slits simulating longitudinal cracks show the effectiveness of the technique and its potential for application to the inspection of a variety of structural components.},

abstract = {The process of implementing a damage identification strategy for aerospace, civil and mechanical engineering infrastructure is referred to as structural health monitoring (SHM). Here, damage is defined as changes to the material and/or geometric properties of these systems, including changes to the boundary conditions and system connectivity, which adversely affect the system's performance. A wide variety of highly effective local non-destructive evaluation tools are available for such monitoring. However, the majority of SHM research conducted over the last 30 years has attempted to identify damage in structures on a more global basis. The past 10 years have seen a rapid increase in the amount of research related to SHM as quantified by the significant escalation in papers published on this subject. The increased interest in SHM and its associated potential for significant life-safety and economic benefits has motivated the need for this theme issue. This introduction begins with a brief history of SHM technology development. Recent research has begun to recognize that the SHM problem is fundamentally one of the statistical pattern recognition (SPR) and a paradigm to address such a problem is described in detail herein as it forms the basis for organization of this theme issue. In the process of providing the historical overview and summarizing the SPR paradigm, the subsequent articles in this theme issue are cited in an effort to show how they fit into this overview of SHM. In conclusion, technical challenges that must be addressed if SHM is to gain wider application are discussed in a general manner. {\textcopyright} 2006 The Royal Society.},

abstract = {Statistical pattern recognition methodologies have gained considerable attention for Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) applications to detect changes in a structure (e.g. damage). For most of such applications, outlier analysis of the damage sensitive features obtained from the SHM data is used to detect the changes in the structure. There are a number of different approaches used by different research groups and it is widely accepted that success of a certain methodology may depend on the structure and/or structural change to be identified. Therefore, it is very important that promising methodologies are verified by using different test structures and damage cases. The main objective of this study is to investigate statistical pattern recognition methods in the context of SHM using different laboratory structures. Time series modeling, i.e. auto-regressive models, is used in conjunction with Mahalanobis distance-based outlier detection algorithms to identify different types of structural changes on different test structures. Similar approaches were reported in the literature but here the methodology is modified by using random decrement functions to eliminate the effects of the exogenous input. Then a number of tests are conducted by using two different test structures in laboratory conditions in order to evaluate the results in a comparable fashion. The first test specimen is a simply supported steel beam where the second structure is a highly redundant steel grid structure. Various damage conditions are simulated by using these structures. The ambient vibration data is analyzed by using the methodology described and results are presented. Finally, the advantages and drawbacks of the methodology are discussed in the light of experimental results. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {A method for damage localization based on the phased array idea has been developed. Four arrays of transducers are used to perform a beam-forming procedure. Each array consists of nine transducers placed along a line, which are able to excite and register elastic waves. The A0 Lamb wave mode has been chosen for the localization method. The arrays are placed in such a way that the angular difference between them is 45° and the rotation point is the middle transducer, which is common for all the arrays. The idea has been tested on a square aluminium plate modeled by the Spectral Element Method. Two types of damage were considered, namely distributed damage, which was modeled as stiffness reduction, and cracks, modeled as separation of nodes between selected spectral elements. The plate is excited by a wave packet. The whole array system is placed in the middle of the plate. Each linear phased array in the system acts independently and produces maps of a scanned field based on the beam-forming procedure. These maps are made of time signals (transferred to space domain) that represent the difference between the damaged plate signals and those from the intact plate. An algorithm was developed to join all four maps. The final map is modified by proposed signal processing algorithm to indicate the damaged area of the plate more precisely. The problem for damage localization was investigated and exemplary maps confirming the effectiveness of the proposed system were obtained. It was also shown that the response of the introduced configuration removes the ambiguity of damage localization normally present when a linear phased array is utilized. The investigation is based exclusively on numerical data. {\textcopyright} SAGE Publications 2009.},

abstract = {The guided wave (GW) field excited by a wedge-shaped, anisotropic piezocomposite transducer, surface-bonded on an isotropic substrate is investigated with applications to large area structural health monitoring. This investigation supports the development of the composite long-range variable-direction emitting radar (CLoVER) transducer. The analysis is based on the three-dimensional equations of elasticity, and the solution yields expressions for the field variables that are able to capture the multimodal nature of GWs. The assumption of uncoupled dynamics between the actuator and substrate is used, and their interaction is modeled through shear tractions along the transducer's radial edges. A similar problem is modeled using three-dimensional finite element simulations to assess the spatial and transient accuracy of the solution. Experimental tests are also conducted on pristine structures to validate the accuracy of the theoretical approach. The experimental studies employ CLoVER transducers developed in-house, and their manufacturing procedure is briefly described. Frequency response experiments based on piezoelectric sensors are conducted to assess the performance of the solution in the frequency domain. These tests are complemented by laser vibrometer measurements that allow the spatial and temporal evolution of the solution to be evaluated. The numerical simulations and experimental tests show that the wave time of arrival, radial attenuation, and azimuthal distribution are well captured by the theoretical solution. {\textcopyright} 2009 IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract = {The Lamb wave-based structural damage detection technique is widely viewed as one of the most encouraging tools for structural health monitoring. However, the propagation of Lamb waves is complicated. Damage-scattering components in the sensing signals may easily be mixed with the waves that come from the source and those reflected from boundaries. Traditionally, damage scattering signals are obtained by comparing test data with a baseline data. However, such a process is affected easily by environmental and operational variability. Major emphases of the research in this article are on developing a baseline-free damage diagnosis technique based on time reversal theory. First, the propagation of the Lamb wave and its time reversal process are discussed. Second, time window functions and improved piezoelectric actuators/sensors array arrangement are developed to separate the scattered signals from the sensing signals. A time reversal imaging method is also adopted to detect and show the damages. This method makes all the scattered signals focus at the corresponding sources so that damages can be revealed. The validity of the proposed method is demonstrated through experiment in which a quasi-isotropic composite plate with PZT array is successfully monitored without relying on any past baseline data.},

Mentioned algorithm uses Lamb wave propagation methods for discontinuities localisation. Elastic waves were generated and received using piezoelectric transducers. They were arranged in concentrated arrays distributed on the specimen surface. In this way almost whole specimen could be monitored using this combined distributed-concentrated transducer network. Excited elastic waves propagate and reflect from panel boundaries and discontinuities existing in the panel. Wave reflection were registered through the piezoelectric transducers and used in signal processing algorithm. Proposed processing algorithm consists of two parts: signal filtering and extraction of obstacles location. The first part was used in order to enhance signals by removing noise from them. Second part allowed to extract features connected with wave reflections from discontinuities. Extracted features damage influence maps were a basis to create damage influence maps. Damage maps indicated intensity of elastic wave reflections which corresponds to obstacles coordinates. Described signal processing algorithms were implemented in the MATLAB environment.

abstract = {For many engineering and aerospace applications, detection and quantification of multiscale damage in fiberreinforced composite structures is increasing in importance. Consequently, the development of an efficient and costeffective diagnosis scheme that can accurately sense, characterize, and evaluate the existence of any form of damage will offer significant potential for improving the performance, reliability, and extending the operational life of these complex systems. We present an approach to characterize and classify different damage states in composite laminates by measuring the change in the signature of the resultant wave that propagates through the anisotropic media under forced excitation. The wave propagation is measured using surface-mounted piezoelectric transducers. Sensor signals collected from test specimens with various forms of induced damage are analyzed using a patternrecognition algorithm known as the one-class support vector machines. The one-class support-vector-machine algorithm performs automatic anomaly detection and classification of damage signatures using various features from the sensor readings. The results obtained suggest that the one-class support-vector-machine algorithm, along with appropriate preprocessing techniques, can often achieve better accuracy than the popular k-nearest-neighbor method in detecting and classifying anomalies caused by structural defects, even when the perturbations caused in the sensor signals due to different damage states are minimal.

As pattern recognition technique, Principal Component Analysis is used to perform the analysis, built a base-line model of the structure without damage and, subsequently to compare the data of the current structure under test. Different indices are calculated to determine how different is the structure under test. Using these indices, it is possible to detect, classify and locate the damage by means of the contribution of each sensor to each index. These methodologies are tested using two different structures, one aircraft turbine blade and one aluminium plate, which were instrumented with seven and four Piezoelectric transducer discs respectively. Seven simulated damages were made in the aircraft turbine blade and four real damages in the aluminium plate.},

Tests were performed with varying stiffness and mass conditions with the assumption that these sources of variability are representative of changing operational and environmental conditions. Damage is simulated through nonlinear effects introduced by a bumper mechanism that induces a repetitive, impact-type nonlinearity. This mechanism intends to simulate the cracks that open and close under dynamic loads or loose connections that rattle.

Advances in computers and digital imaging technology have allowed 3D digital image correlation (DIC) methods to measure the shape and deformation of a vibrating structure. This technique allows for full-field measurement of structural response, thus providing a wealth of simultaneous test data. This paper presents some preliminary results for the test/analysis/correlation of data measured using the DIC approach along with traditional accelerometers and a scanning laser vibrometer for comparison to a finite element model. The results indicate that all three approaches correlated well with the finite element model and provide validation for the DIC approach for full-field vibration measurement.

abstract = {A comprehensive review on modal parameter-based damage identification methods for beam- or plate-type structures is presented, and the damage identification algorithms in terms of signal processing are particularly emphasized. Based on the vibration features, the damage identification methods are classified into four major categories: natural frequency-based methods, mode shape-based methods, curvature mode shape-based methods, and methods using both mode shapes and frequencies, and their merits and drawbacks are discussed. It is observed that most mode shape-based and curvature mode shape-based methods only focus on damage localization. In order to precisely locate the damage, the mode shape-based methods have to rely on optimization algorithms or signal processing techniques; while the curvature mode shape-based methods are in general a very effective type of damage localization algorithms. As an implementation, a comparative study of five extensively-used damage detection algorithms for beam-type structures is conducted to evaluate and demonstrate the validity and effectiveness of the signal processing algorithms. This brief review aims to help the readers in identifying starting points for research in vibration-based damage identification and structural health monitoring and guides researchers and practitioners in better implementing available damage identification algorithms and signal processing methods for beam- or plate-type structures.},

In the course of the rapid advancement of diagnostic methods utilising elastic wave propagation, it has become clear that existing methods of elastic wave modeling and analysis are not always very useful; developing numerical methods aimed at modeling and analysing these phenomena has become a necessity. Furthermore, any methods developed need to be verified experimentally, which has become achievable with the advancement of measurement methods utilising laser vibrometry. Guided Waves in Structures for SHM reports on the simulation, analysis and experimental investigation related propagation of elastic waves in isotropic or laminated structures. The full spectrum of theoretical and practical issues associated with propagation of elastic waves is presented and discussed in this one study. Key features: Covers both numerical and experimental aspects of modeling, analysis and measurement of elastic wave propagation in structural elements formed from isotropic or composite materials. Comprehensively discusses the application of the Spectral Finite Element Method for modelling and analysing elastic wave propagation in diverse structural elements. Presents results of experimental measurements employing advanced laser technologies, validating the quality and correctness of the developed numerical models. Accompanying website (www.wiley.com/go/ostachowicz) contains demonstration versions of commercial software developed by the authors for modelling and analyzing elastic wave propagation using the Spectral Finite Element Method.

A total of 400 respondents participated in this survey, conducted around the tourist attractions in Penang, using cluster random sampling. However, only 370 questionnaires were only used for this research. Data were analysed using SPSS software 22 version. The findings, ‘knowledge and novelty seeking' were the main push factors that drove long-haul travel by international tourists to Penang. Meanwhile, the main pull factor that attracts long- haul travel by international tourists to Penang was its ‘culture and history'. Additionally, there were partly direct and significant relationships between socio-demographic, trip characteristics and travel motivation (push factors and pull factors). Overall, this study identified the long-haul travel motivations by international tourists to Penang based on socio-demographic, trip characteristics and travel motivation and has indirectly helped in understanding the long-haul travel market particularly for Penang and Southeast Asia. This research also suggested for an effective marketing and promotion strategy in pro- viding useful information that is the key to attract international tourists to travel long distances.

abstract = {Vibration-based damage detection (VBDD) comprises a promising set of techniques for damage detection and health monitoring of civil engineering structures. However, the successful application of these methods to real structures is still a challenging task, due primarily to the large size of such structures and the relatively high levels of variability in their dynamic response under operational load conditions. In this paper, a new methodology is introduced for the application of VBDD techniques, with the goal of enhancing their effectiveness for identifying and locating low damage levels and improving their applicability to the continuous or periodic health monitoring of structures. The basic features of the methodology include the use of a controlled and consistent excitation force, the use of operational deflection shapes (ODSs) at all measured frequency increments rather than only at natural frequencies, the use of a logarithmic scale for representing the ODS amplitudes at each frequency increment and the establishment of a threshold level for damage detection that accounts for experimental variability. The performance of the proposed methodology is verified and demonstrated by applying several Level 1 (damage detection) and Level 2 (damage localization) VBDD techniques using experimental data measured on a steel girder taken from a railway bridge. The proposed approach is shown to perform very well at detecting, locating and monitoring the growth of damage. Copyright {\textcopyright} 2011 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

abstract = {In the case of composite structures, low-velocity impact events can cause various types of damage that are mostly hidden inside the laminates or occur on the side opposite to the impact. Thus, damage cannot be easily detected by visual inspection or conventional NDT techniques. Moreover, if the damage occurs between the scheduled inspection periods, the possibilities of extensive damage or catastrophic failure can be increased. For these reasons, built-in NDT systems, such as the real-time impact monitoring system, are required in most composite structures for high reliability and ease of maintenance. In this paper, such an impact monitoring system, including impact location detection and damage assessment techniques, was studied for composite flat and stiffened panels. In order to acquire the impact-induced acoustic signals, four multiplexed fiber Bragg gratings (FBGs) and commercial high-speed FBG interrogator were used. In signal processing for the detection of impact locations and damage occurrences, neural networks and wavelet transforms were adopted. Finally, these algorithms were embodied usingMATLAB and LabVIEW software to obtain a user-friendly interface. {\textcopyright} 2012 Koninklijke Brill NV, Leiden.},

abstract = {Fibre composite structures have become the most attractive candidate for civil engineering applications. Fibre reinforced plastic polymer (FRP) composite materials have been used in the rehabilitation and replacement of the old degrading traditional structures or build new structures. However, the lack of design standards for civil infrastructure limits their structural applications. The majority of the existing applications have been designed based on the research and guidelines provided by the fibre composite manufacturers or based on the designer's experience. It has been a tendency that the final structure is generally over-designed. This paper provides a review on the available studies related to the design optimization of fibre composite structures used in civil engineering such as; plate, beam, box beam, sandwich panel, bridge girder, and bridge deck. Various optimization methods are presented and compared. In addition, the importance of using the appropriate optimization technique is discussed.

The proposed model includes the cumulative role of transducer elements (actuator and sensor), substrate structure, and transducer/structure interaction, in the prediction of the full pitch-catch guided wave response under changing temperature. Experimental tests were carried out in a controlled environmental chamber at different temperatures ranging from -40 °C up to 60°C. Time and frequency domain based system responses were obtained. Numerical versus experimental results show that the proposed model is capable of capturing the effect of temperature on PZTs generated/received Lamb waves with great accuracy. In addition, because the SAFE is capable to model also wave propagation in anisotropic plates, the proposed model can lay the groundwork for the development of more robust Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) strategies for complex aerospace structures. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

To make training faster, we used non-saturating neurons and a very efficient GPU implementation of the convolution operation. To reduce overfitting in the fully-connected layers we employed a recently-developed regularization method called "dropout" that proved to be very effective.

abstract = {Lamb waves are dispersive and multi-modal, which makes the interpretation of Lamb wave signals very difficult in either the time or frequency domain. In the this article, we present our studies on Lamb wave propagation characterization and crack detection using a hybrid lead zirconate titanate (PZT)-laser vibrometer system and frequency-wave number analysis. A scanning laser Doppler vibrometer is used to acquiring high-resolution time-space Lamb wavefield excited by a PZT actuator. The recorded wavefield is then transformed to frequency-wave number domain by two-dimensional Fourier transform. Wave spectrum in the frequency-wave number domain shows clear distinction among Lamb wave modes being present. These concepts are illustrated through several experimental tests. However, the space information is lost during this transformation. A short-space two-dimensional Fourier transform is then adopted to obtain the frequency-wave number spectra at various spatial locations, resulting in the space-frequency-wave number representation, which can show how the frequency-wave number component varies with respect to space dimension. It provides a means to study the wave propagation from the perspective of wave number domain. The space-frequency-wave number analysis has successfully been used for the study of wave interaction with structural discontinuity and crack detection on an aluminum plate. {\textcopyright} The Author(s) 2013.},

abstract = {The signals acquired by measurements of elastic wave propagation have been used for damage detection since the 1970s. The measurements have been carried out mostly by using piezoelectric transducers of various types. Many different sensor configurations and data processing have been proposed to detect and localise structural defects, both for real-time and off-line testing. Nevertheless, in the last decade, significant progress in the measurement techniques such as scanning laser Doppler vibrometry and shearographic interferometry has been made. These techniques enable measurement of a full wavefield of elastic waves. This opens up new possibilities and solutions for the problems of the damage detection in structures. Many researchers successfully applied this type of measurements for the damage detection and localisation in thin-walled structures. Moreover, advanced signal processing techniques, such as wavenumber filtering, give the possibility of damage size estimation, by filling the gap between damage detection and damage prognosis. The aim of this paper is to give a comprehensive review of methods used for the full wavefield measurement. It also describes and compares selected signal processing algorithms developed for damage detection and visualisation based on these measuring techniques. Criticism aspects, as well as advantages of each algorithm, are denoted based on the authors' expertise in the field. {\textcopyright} 2014 Wiley Publishing Ltd.},

The method is also appropriate for non-stationary objectives and problems with very noisy and/or sparse gradients. The hyper-parameters have intuitive interpretations and typically require little tuning. Some connections to related algorithms, on which Adam was inspired, are discussed. We also analyze the theoretical convergence properties of the algorithm and provide a regret bound on the convergence rate that is comparable to the best known results under the online convex optimization framework. Empirical results demonstrate that Adam works well in practice and compares favorably to other stochastic optimization methods.

Differently of typical applications of EMI applied to SHM, which are based on computing the Frequency Response Function (FRF), in this work the procedure is based on the EMI principle but all analysis is conducted directly in time-domain. For this, the PCC are computed from the time response of PZT (Lead Zirconate Titanate) transducers bonded to the monitored structure, which act as actuator and sensor at the same time. The procedure is carried out exciting the PZT transducers using a wide band chirp signal and getting their time responses. The PCC are obtained in both healthy and damaged conditions and used to compute statistics indexes. Tests were carried out on an aircraft aluminum plate and the results have demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed method making it an excellent approach for SHM applications.

abstract = {This article is concerned with the experimental validation of a structural health monitoring methodology for damage detection and identification. Three different data-driven multivariate algorithms are considered here to obtain the baseline pattern. These are based on principal component analysis, independent component analysis and hierarchical non-linear principal component analysis. The contribution of this article is to examine and compare the three proposed algorithms that have been reported as reliable methods for damage detection and identification. The approach is based on a distributed piezoelectric active sensor network for the excitation and detection of structural dynamic responses. A woven multilayered composite plate and a simplified aircraft composite skin panel are used as examples to test the approaches. Data-driven baseline patterns are built when the structure is known to be healthy from wavelet coefficients of the structural dynamic responses. Damage is then simulated by adding masses at different positions of the structures. The data from the structure in different states (damaged or not) are then projected into the different models by each actuator in order to generate the input feature vectors of a self-organizing map from the computed components together with squared prediction error measures. All three methods are shown to be successful in detecting and classifying the simulated damages. At the end, a critical comparison is given in order to investigate the advantages and disadvantages of each method for the damage detection and identification tasks.},

abstract = {Structural health monitoring has received remarkable attention due to the arising structural safety problems. Most of these structural health problems are accumulative damages such as slight changes in structural deformations which are very hard to be detected. In addition, the complexity of real structure and environmental noises make structural health monitoring more difficult. Existing methods largely use various types of sensors to collect useful parameters and then train a machine learning model to diagnose damage level and location, in which a large amount of training data are needed for the model training, while the labeled data are rare in the real world. To overcome this problem, sparse coding is employed in this paper to achieve structural health monitoring of a bridge equipped with a wireless sensor network, so that a large amount of unlabeled examples can be used to train a feature extractor based on the sparse coding algorithm. Features learned from sparse coding are then used to train a neural network classifier to distinguish different statuses of the bridge. Experimental results show the sparse coding-based deep learning algorithm achieves higher accuracy for structural health monitoring under the same level of environmental noises, compared with some existing methods.},

abstract = {Abstract A rapid, fully non-contact, hybrid system which encompasses an air-coupled transducer (ACT) and a laser Doppler vibrometer (LDV) is presented for profiling A<inf>0</inf> Lamb wave dispersion of an isotropic aluminum plate. The ACT generates ultrasonic pressure incident upon the surface of the plate. The pressure waves are partially refracted into the plate. The LDV is employed to measure the out-of-plane velocity of the excited Lamb wave mode at some distances where the Lamb waves are formed in the plate. The influence of the ACT angle of incidence on Lamb wave excitation is investigated and Snell's law is used to directly compute Lamb wave dispersion curves including phase and group velocity dispersion curves in aluminum plates from incident angles found to generate optimal A<inf>0</inf> Lamb wave mode. The measured curves are compared to results obtained from a two-dimensional (2-D) Fast Fourier transform (FFT), Morlet wavelet transform (MWT) and theoretical predictions. It was concluded that the experimental results obtained using Snell's law concept are well in accordance with the theoretical solutions. The high degree of accuracy in the measured data with the theoretical results proved a high sensitivity of the air-coupled and laser ultrasound in characterizing Lamb wave dispersion in plate-like structures. The proposed non-contact hybrid system can effectively characterize the dispersive relation without knowledge of neither the materials characteristics nor the mathematical model.},

In this paper, we present a network and training strategy that relies on the strong use of data augmentation to use the available annotated samples more efficiently. The architecture consists of a contracting path to capture context and a symmetric expanding path that enables precise localization. We show that such a network can be trained end-to-end from very few images and outperforms the prior best method (a sliding-window convolutional network) on the ISBI challenge for segmentation of neuronal structures in electron microscopic stacks. Using the same network trained on transmitted light microscopy images (phase contrast and DIC) we won the ISBI cell tracking challenge 2015 in these categories by a large margin. Moreover, the network is fast. Segmentation of a 512x512 image takes less than a second on a recent GPU.

@article{Ioffe2015,
abstract = {Training Deep Neural Networks is complicated by the fact that the distribution of each layer's inputs changes during training, as the parameters of the previous layers change. This slows down the training by requiring lower learning rates and careful parameter initialization, and makes it notoriously hard to train models with saturating nonlinearities. We refer to this phenomenon as internal covariate shift, and address the problem by normalizing layer inputs. Our method draws its strength from making normalization a part of the model architecture and performing the normalization for each training mini-batch. Batch Normalization allows us to use much higher learning rates and be less careful about initialization. It also acts as a regularizer, in some cases eliminating the need for Dropout. Applied to a state-of-the-art image classification model, Batch Normalization achieves the same accuracy with 14 times fewer training steps, and beats the original model by a significant margin. Using an ensemble of batch-normalized networks, we improve upon the best published result on ImageNet classification: reaching 4.9% top-5 validation error (and 4.8% test error), exceeding the accuracy of human raters.},

abstract = {This research is related to a signal processing of full wavefield data as an effective tool for detection, localization and visualization of a crack growth in thin-walled structures. Full wavefield data of propagating Lamb waves in structures such as plates and shells made out of metallic alloys and composite laminates contain a wealth of information about wave pattern anomalies due to occurrence of a damage. The aim is to demonstrate a method for enhancing damage visualization in structures such that estimation of the length and orientation of the crack can be easily obtained. The proposed signal processing involves application of discrete fast Fourier transform, wavenumber domain filtering and inverse discrete Fourier transform. The method is further enhanced by a technique for compensation of the wave attenuation so that the effects of structural damage have the same influence regardless of the location. The concept is first illustrated on numerically simulated data, and then tested on experimental results. In the experiments, full wavefield measurements are obtained using a scanning laser Doppler vibrometer, which allows the measurement of displacements and/or velocities along three axes over a user-defined grid. In the proposed method only out-of-plane velocities are used. Tests performed on simple aluminum and composite plates with artificially introduced longitudinal cracks confirm the effectiveness of the method and its potential for application to the inspection of a variety of structural components. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

The wave propagation data are used to determine the location and degree of damage in metallic and composite plates. The structural components are to be instrumented with array of actuators and sensors (PCB) able to excite and record its dynamic response. A damage index, calculated from the measured wave propagation data in a reference state (baseline) and the current state, is introduced as a determinant of structural damage. The index is a relative measure comparing the two states of the structure under the same ambient conditions. The damage index increase its intensity when the damage size increase too. Moreover, its calculation in different paths associated with the Artificial Neural Networks or Probability Ellipse methods allow to identify position and entity of the damage. Two panels made by aluminum and fabric composite material have been used for tests. A damage entities simulated as through-thickness hole with diameter equal to 6. mm has been investigated for aluminium panel while three damage entities (through-thickness hole with size equal to 2.5. mm, 4.5. mm and 9. mm) have been investigated for that in composite material. In order to get a training, needful for the application of the ANN method, finite elements analysis have been performed for the aluminum panel taking into account several damage paths. Simulations have been performed in order to characterize the propagation path of the Lamb waves in composite plate changing the damage entities from hole diameter equal to 2.5. mm up to 9. mm. Damage index for each damage size for both simulations and tests will be compared. The potential applications of these methods in developing health monitoring systems in defects-critical structures and in composite material structures are discussed.},

abstract = {Structural health monitoring (SHM) is usually focused on damage detection (e.g., Yes/No) or approximate estimation of damage size. Any additional details of the damage such as configuration, shape, networking, geometrical statistics, etc., are often either ignored or significantly simplified during SHM characterization. These details, however, can be extremely important for understanding of damage severity and estimations of follow-up damage growth risk. To avoid expensive human participation and/or over-conservative SHM decisions, solutions of computational recognition for damage characterization are needed. Autonomous SHM from visual data is one of the significant challenges in the field of structural prognostics and health monitoring (PHM). The main shortcomings of the image-based PHM algorithms arise from the lack of robustness and fidelity to handle the variability of environment and nature of damage types. In recent times, deep learning has drawn huge amount of traction in the field of machine learning and visual pattern recognition due to its superior performance compared to the state-of-the-art techniques. This paper proposes to formulate and apply a deep learning technique to characterize the damage in the form of cracks on a composite material. The deep learning architecture is constructed by multi-layer neural network that is based on the fundamentals of unsupervised representational learning theory. The robustness and the accuracy of the approach is validated on an extensive set of real image data collected via applying variable load conditions on the structure. The paper has shown a high characterization accuracy over a wide range of loading conditions with limited number of labeled training image data.},

abstract = {14. Sponsoring Agency Code-15. Supplementary Notes-16. Abstract Concrete cracking is a ubiquitous phenomenon, present in all types of concrete structures. Identifying and tracking the amount and severity of cracking is paramount to evaluating the current condition and predicting the future service life of a concrete asset. Concrete cracks can indicate reinforcement corrosion, the development of spalls or changing support conditions. Therefore, monitoring cracks during the life span of concrete structures has been an effective technique to evaluate the level of safety and preparing plans for future appropriate rehabilitation. One growing technique are unmanned inspections using Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV). UAVs are drones equipped with cameras, sensors, GPS, etc. RGB images (color images in Red, Green and Blue color space) are obtained from a camera mounted on a UAV flying around the structure, to detect cracks and other defects. Each image captured by UAV needs to be evaluated to track the crack formations. To save time, this task can be done by applying image processing techniques to automatically detect and report cracks rather than using a human to identify them. In addition, processing RGB images with sufficient information, such as the distance of camera to surface for each picture, will provide the dimension of the cracks (length and width).},

The SHM field encompasses transdisciplinary areas, including smart materials, sensors and actuators, damage diagnosis and prognosis, signal and image processing algorithms, wireless intelligent sensing, data fusion, and energy harvesting. This book focuses on how SHM techniques are applied to aircraft structures with particular emphasis on composite materials, and is divided into four main parts. Part One provides an overview of SHM technologies for damage detection, diagnosis, and prognosis in aerospace structures. Part Two moves on to analyze smart materials for SHM in aerospace structures, such as piezoelectric materials, optical fibers, and flexoelectricity. In addition, this also includes two vibration-based energy harvesting techniques for powering wireless sensors based on piezoelectric electromechanical coupling and diamagnetic levitation. Part Three explores innovative SHM technologies for damage diagnosis in aerospace structures. Chapters within this section include sparse array imaging techniques and phase array techniques for damage detection. The final section of the volume details innovative SHM technologies for damage prognosis in aerospace structures. This book serves as a key reference for researchers working within this industry, academic, and government research agencies developing new systems for the SHM of aerospace structures and materials scientists.

Different information about the state of the structure can be obtained in the process, among them, detection, localization and classification of damages are mainly studied in order to avoid unnecessary maintenance procedures in civilian and military structures in several applications. To carry out SHM in prac- tice, two different approaches are used, the first is based on modelling which requires to build a very detailed model of the structure, while the second is by means of data-driven approaches which use information collected from the structure under different struc- tural states and perform an analysis by means of data analysis . For the latter, statisti- cal analysis and pattern recognition have demonstrated its effectiveness in the damage identification process because real information is obtained from the structure through sensors installed permanently to the observed object allowing a real-time monitoring. This chapter describes a damage detection and classification methodology, which makes use of a piezoelectric active system which works in several actuation phases and that is attached to the structure under evaluation, principal component analysis, and machine learning algorithms working as a pattern recognition methodology.

abstract = {Composite materials are nowadays widely used in several applications, especially in the aerospace field. Despite the numerous advantages that composites can offer, the health monitoring of this type of structures is challenging. A major challenge regards the detection and monitoring of delaminations. In the case of aeronautical structures, delaminations are often caused by impacts with external objects. Therefore, the capability of detection, localization and reconstruction of occurring impacts becomes an essential health monitoring tool for the estimation of the remaining structure lifetime. In this paper, we propose a new procedure for the reconstruction of impacts, based on the structural model and on measured vibration data. The procedure is tested over a carbon fiber reinforced composite plate, instrumented with surface mounted fiber Bragg grating sensors. The experimental results show that the proposed algorithm (VS-LS) can localize and reconstruct the impact forces with at least three times better accuracy than the classical pseudo-inverse method.},

@article{Tibaduiza2016,
abstract = {One of the most important tasks in structural health monitoring corresponds to damage detection. In this task, the existence of damage should be determined. In the literature, several potentially useful techniques for damage detection can be found, and their applicability to a particular situation depends on the size of the critical damages that are admissible in the structure. Almost all of these techniques follow the same general procedure: the structure is excited using actuators, and the dynamical response is sensed at different locations throughout the structure. Any damage will change this vibrational response. The state of the structure is diagnosed by means of the processing of these data. Several studies have shown that the detection of changes in a structure depends on the distance from the damage to the actuator as well as the configuration of the sensor network. In this article, the authors considered the advantage of using an active piezoelectric system, where the lead zirconate titanate transducers are used as actuator and sensors in different actuation phases. In each actuation phase of the diagnosis procedure, one lead zirconate titanate transducer is used as actuator (a known electrical signal is applied), and the others are used as sensors (collecting the wave propagated through the structure at different points). An initial baseline model for undamaged structure is built applying principal component analysis to the data collected by several experiments and after the current structure (damaged or not) is subjected to the same experiments, and the collected data are projected into the principal component analysis models. Two of these projections and four damage indices (T 2-statistic, Q-statistic, combined index, and I 2 index) by each actuation phase are used to determine the presence of damages and to distinguish between them. These indices are calculated based on the analysis of the residual data matrix to represent the variability of the data projected within the residual subspace and the new space of the principal components. To validate the approach, data from two aeronautical structures - an aircraft skin panel and an aircraft turbine blade - are used.},

We show that convolutional networks by themselves, trained end-to-end, pixels-to-pixels, improve on the previous best result in semantic segmentation. Our key insight is to build 'fully convolutional' networks that take input of arbitrary size and produce correspondingly-sized output with efficient inference and learning. We define and detail the space of fully convolutional networks, explain their application to spatially dense prediction tasks, and draw connections to prior models. We adapt contemporary classification networks (AlexNet, the VGG net, and GoogLeNet) into fully convolutional networks and transfer their learned representations by fine-tuning to the segmentation task. We then define a skip architecture that combines semantic information from a deep, coarse layer with appearance information from a shallow, fine layer to produce accurate and detailed segmentations. Our fully convolutional networks achieve improved segmentation of PASCAL VOC (30% relative improvement to 67.2% mean IU on 2012), NYUDv2, SIFT Flow, and PASCAL-Context, while inference takes one tenth of a second for a typical image.},

abstract = {A number of image processing techniques (IPTs) have been implemented for detecting civil infrastructure defects to partially replace human-conducted onsite inspections. These IPTs are primarily used to manipulate images to extract defect features, such as cracks in concrete and steel surfaces. However, the extensively varying real-world situations (e.g., lighting and shadow changes) can lead to challenges to the wide adoption of IPTs. To overcome these challenges, this article proposes a vision-based method using a deep architecture of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for detecting concrete cracks without calculating the defect features. As CNNs are capable of learning image features automatically, the proposed method works without the conjugation of IPTs for extracting features. The designed CNN is trained on 40 K images of 256 × 256 pixel resolutions and, consequently, records with about 98% accuracy. The trained CNN is combined with a sliding window technique to scan any image size larger than 256 × 256 pixel resolutions. The robustness and adaptability of the proposed approach are tested on 55 images of 5,888 × 3,584 pixel resolutions taken from a different structure which is not used for training and validation processes under various conditions (e.g., strong light spot, shadows, and very thin cracks). Comparative studies are conducted to examine the performance of the proposed CNN using traditional Canny and Sobel edge detection methods. The results show that the proposed method shows quite better performances and can indeed find concrete cracks in realistic situations.},

abstract = {Structural health monitoring (SHM) and vibration-based structural damage detection have been a continuous interest for civil, mechanical and aerospace engineers over the decades. Early and meticulous damage detection has always been one of the principal objectives of SHM applications. The performance of a classical damage detection system predominantly depends on the choice of the features and the classifier. While the fixed and hand-crafted features may either be a sub-optimal choice for a particular structure or fail to achieve the same level of performance on another structure, they usually require a large computation power which may hinder their usage for real-time structural damage detection. This paper presents a novel, fast and accurate structural damage detection system using 1D Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) that has an inherent adaptive design to fuse both feature extraction and classification blocks into a single and compact learning body. The proposed method performs vibration-based damage detection and localization of the damage in real-time. The advantage of this approach is its ability to extract optimal damage-sensitive features automatically from the raw acceleration signals. Large-scale experiments conducted on a grandstand simulator revealed an outstanding performance and verified the computational efficiency of the proposed real-time damage detection method.},

In this paper we investigate the potential mechanisms for this increase through finite element simulations and demonstrate that the shear lag effect through the adhesive is the major source of the signal amplitude difference between the direct and remote bonding cases.},

abstract = {In recent years, the interest for the automatic evaluation of the state of civil structures is increased. The development of Structural Health Monitoring is allowed by the low costs of the hardware and the improving of the computational capacity of computers that can analyze considerable amount of data in short time. A Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) system should continuously monitor structures, extracting and processing relevant information, to efficiently allocate the resources for maintenance and ensure the security of the structure. Considering the latest developments in this field, great attention has been paid to data-based approaches, especially to autoregressive models; these econometric models, born in the field of finance, are usually used to analyze the vibration time series provided by the sensors applied on the monitored structures. Indexes based on these autoregressive models can be used as features by which the structural integrity can be assessed. This work proposes the application of a multivariable analysis, Principal Component Analysis (PCA), to the set of the autoregressive model parameters estimated on the vibration responses of a real structure under operational conditions. This approach reduces a complex set of data to a lower dimension, by representing the behavior of the structure through the few variables. This work uses the principal components of the autoregressive model parameters as indicators that can effectively describe different operational levels and some important environmental effects. The strategy is applied for the first time on the data collected by the long-time monitoring system installed on the stands of the G. Meazza stadium in Milan. The results will show that this procedure is effective in representing the status of the structure and can be used in a structural health monitoring prospective.},

abstract = {State-of-the-art approaches for semantic image segmentation are built on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The typical segmentation architecture is composed of (a) a downsampling path responsible for extracting coarse semantic features, followed by (b) an upsampling path trained to recover the input image resolution at the output of the model and, optionally, (c) a post-processing module (e.g. Conditional Random Fields) to refine the model predictions. Recently, a new CNN architecture, Densely Connected Convolutional Networks (DenseNets), has shown excellent results on image classification tasks. The idea of DenseNets is based on the observation that if each layer is directly connected to every other layer in a feed-forward fashion then the network will be more accurate and easier to train. In this paper, we extend DenseNets to deal with the problem of semantic segmentation. We achieve state-of-the-art results on urban scene benchmark datasets such as CamVid and Gatech, without any further post-processing module nor pretraining. Moreover, due to smart construction of the model, our approach has much less parameters than currently published best entries for these datasets.},

However, traditional physics based models do not provide an accurate representation, and classic data driven techniques, such as a support vector machine, are too simplistic to capture the complex nature of ultrasonic guide waves. To address this challenge, this paper uses a deep learning interpretation of ultrasonic guided waves to achieve fast, accurate, and automated structural damaged detection. To achieve this, full wavefield scans of thin metal plates are used, half from the undamaged state and half from the damaged state. This data is used to train our deep network to predict the damage state of a plate with 99.98% accuracy given signals from just 10 spatial locations on the plate, as compared to that of a support vector machine (SVM), which achieved a 62% accuracy.},

CFRP laminates were subjected to low-velocity impact to introduce barely visible impact damage. In order to improve the signal-to-noise ratio of the detected ultrasonic signal, retroreflective tape and a signal averaging process were used. We thus successfully visualized the propagation of the pulsed Lamb A0 mode in the CFRP laminates without contact. Interactions between the Lamb waves and impact damage were clearly observed and the damage was easily detected through the change in wave propagation. Furthermore, we demonstrated that the damage could be rapidly detected without signal averaging. This method has significant advantages in detecting damage compared to the conventional method using a contact resonant ultrasonic transducer due to the absence of the ringing phenomenon when using the LDV.},

abstract = {Guided wave structural health monitoring uses sparse sensor networks embedded in sophisticated structures for defect detection and characterization. The biggest challenge of those sensor networks is developing robust techniques for reliable damage detection under changing environmental and operating conditions (EOC). To address this challenge, we develop a novelty classifier for damage detection based on one class support vector machines. We identify appropriate features for damage detection and introduce a feature aggregation method which quadratically increases the number of available training observations. We adopt a two-level voting scheme by using an ensemble of classifiers and predictions. Each classifier is trained on a different segment of the guided wave signal, and each classifier makes an ensemble of predictions based on a single observation. Using this approach, the classifier can be trained using a small number of baseline signals. We study the performance using Monte-Carlo simulations of an analytical model and data from impact damage experiments on a glass fiber composite plate. We also demonstrate the classifier performance using two types of baseline signals: fixed and rolling baseline training set. The former requires prior knowledge of baseline signals from all EOC, while the latter does not and leverages the fact that EOC vary slowly over time and can be modeled as a Gaussian process.},

The second approach offers wider coverage of the structure; it is based on identifying the changes caused by damage on the strain field in the whole structure for similar external loads.

The precursory micro-cracking activity and fracture behavior of crumb rubber concrete with different rubber contents, 0%, 10%, and 15%, were analyzed. The various acoustic emission statistical parameters including cumulative event, frequency distribution, amplitude distribution, and b-value were used for the analysis. The general fracture process is similar for all normal and crumb rubber concretes and can be divided into three distinct stages of micro-crack activity, namely, early stage, main collapse stage, and post-fracture stage. The following conclusions were drawn from the analysis: (1) more micro-cracks initiated and grew at early stage in the normal concrete, while less micro-cracks in the crumb rubber concrete but with longer stage duration; (2) the duration and crack number are both increasing with the increase in the rubber contents in main collapse and post-fracture stages; (3) new crack types associated with the rubber particles were recorded due to the change of the peak frequencies; and (4) the amplitude of the cracks decrease with the increase in the rubber content due to the damping ratio and interface improvement by the mixed rubbers.

abstract = {Structural health monitoring using ultrasonic guided waves relies on accurate interpretation of guided wave propagation to distinguish damage state indicators. However, traditional physics based models do not provide an accurate representation, and classic data driven techniques, such as a support vector machine, are too simplistic to capture the complex nature of ultrasonic guide waves. To address this challenge, this paper uses a deep learning interpretation of ultrasonic guided waves to achieve fast, accurate, and automated structural damaged detection. To achieve this, full wavefield scans of thin metal plates are used, half from the undamaged state and half from the damaged state. This data is used to train our deep network to predict the damage state of a plate with 99.98% accuracy given signals from just 10 spatial locations on the plate, as compared to that of a support vector machine (SVM), which achieved a 62% accuracy.},

abstract = {Inspection strategies with guided wave-based approaches give to structural health monitoring (SHM) applications several advantages, among them, the possibility of the use of real data from the structure which enables continuous monitoring and online damage identification. These kinds of inspection strategies are based on the fact that these waves can propagate over relatively long distances and are able to interact sensitively with and uniquely with different types of defects. The principal goal for SHM is oriented to the development of efficient methodologies to process these data and provide results associated with the different levels of the damage identification process. As a contribution, this work presents a damage detection and classification methodology which includes the use of data collected from a structure under different structural states by means of a piezoelectric sensor network taking advantage of the use of guided waves, hierarchical nonlinear principal component analysis (h-NLPCA), and machine learning. The methodology is evaluated and tested in two structures: (i) a carbon fibre reinforced polymer (CFRP) sandwich structure with some damages on the multilayered composite sandwich structure and (ii) a CFRP composite plate. Damages in the structures were intentionally produced to simulate different damage mechanisms, that is, delamination and cracking of the skin.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2018 SPIE. Many convolutional neural networks (CNN)-based approaches were proposed and applied to detect damage in various civil structures in recent years. Usually, the training process of the classical CNN requires a large number of labeled data which is from the monitored structure in undamaged and various damaged scenarios. However, it is impractical to acquire sufficient data that can be exactly labeled with damaged from the infrastructures in service as training data. Thus, we propose a novel unsupervised CNN-based approach to automatically extract optimal feature representations from the unlabeled data in a single class. In the case study, a known dataset from an undamaged scenario is used to train CNN and a dataset from an unknown scenario is used to test the trained CNN. The proposed approach in unsupervised learning is capable of extracting feature representations from the raw acceleration signals that are sensitive to the presence of damage. Then, the extracted damage-sensitive features are fed into a one-class support vector machine (OC-SVM) for novelty detection. The feature set from the undamaged dataset is taken as training dataset to train the OC-SVM, and the extracted features from the unknown dataset are used for testing. In order to verify the effectiveness of the proposed approach in structural damage localization, a number of accelerometers are used to acquire sufficient raw acceleration data from a lab-scale steel bridge, and the preliminary experimental results show that the proposed novel CNN-based approach performs very well in damage localization.},

abstract = {This chapter poses the damage detection for civil, mechanical, and aerospace structures in the context of a pattern recognition paradigm for structural health monitoring (SHM), where machine learning algorithms are essential to learn the structural behavior from experience, following the same principle of the human brain. These algorithms are especially relevant in cases where the damage-sensitive features extracted from the structural responses are affected by changes caused by operational and environmental variability and changes caused by damage. State-of-the-art machine learning algorithms are presented based on Mahalanobis squared distance (MSD), Gaussian mixture models (GMMs), principal component analysis (PCA), kernel principal component analysis (KPCA), and autoassociative neural network (ANN); the bioinspired algorithms are highlighted as promising algorithms to overcome some of the limitations of the more traditional ones. All the algorithms present different working principles and seek to generalize the normal structural condition in order to detect deviations, from the baseline condition, associated with damage. The applicability of the chosen algorithms for damage detection will be tested on standard data sets from the Z-24 Bridge in Switzerland. These data sets are unique as they combine 1-year monitoring from the baseline condition, when influenced by extreme operational and environmental variability, with realistic damage scenarios.},

abstract = {<p>The widespread application of sophisticated structural health monitoring systems in civil infrastructures produces a large volume of data. As a result, the analysis and mining of structural health monitoring data have become hot research topics in the field of civil engineering. However, the harsh environment of civil structures causes the data measured by structural health monitoring systems to be contaminated by multiple anomalies, which seriously affect the data analysis results. This is one of the main barriers to automatic real-time warning, because it is difficult to distinguish the anomalies caused by structural damage from those related to incorrect data. Existing methods for data cleansing mainly focus on noise filtering, whereas the detection of incorrect data requires expertise and is very time-consuming. Inspired by the real-world manual inspection process, this article proposes a computer vision and deep learning–based data anomaly detection method. In particular, the framework of the proposed method includes two steps: data conversion by data visualization, and the construction and training of deep neural networks for anomaly classification. This process imitates human biological vision and logical thinking. In the data visualization step, the time series signals are transformed into image vectors that are plotted piecewise in grayscale images. In the second step, a training dataset consisting of randomly selected and manually labeled image vectors is input into a deep neural network or a cluster of deep neural networks, which are trained via techniques termed stacked autoencoders and greedy layer-wise training. The trained deep neural networks can be used to detect potential anomalies in large amounts of unchecked structural health monitoring data. To illustrate the training procedure and validate the performance of the proposed method, acceleration data from the structural health monitoring system of a real long-span bridge in China are employed. The results show that the multi-pattern anomalies of the data can be automatically detected with high accuracy.</p>},

Yet, these methods require a considerable amount of time to acquire full wavefield data. Therefore, there is a significant need to reduce acquisition time. In this preliminary work, we present a transfer learning approach for reducing the number of sampled measurements necessary. Our method utilizes numerical simula- tions, combined with a small number of spatially sampled random measurements from an experimental structure, to reconstruct full wavefield data. Specifically, we use an autoencoder neural network to learn low-dimensional representations of wave propagation from numerical simulations. We then input a few experimental measurements into the neural network to reconstruct full wave- field data. To demonstrate the ability of our framework, we show our initial success in three scenarios. We show reconstruction accuracies of 86% with one-fourth of the total measurements.},

The early detection of damage in composite structures, such as airplanes, is imperative to avoid catastrophic failure and tragic consequences. This paper reports on the use of machine learning techniques for the damage assessment (i.e., detection, quantification, and localization) of smart composite structures. The success of the machine learning paradigm for damage assessment depends on the representational capability of the discriminative features for the problems of interest. However, from a practical standpoint, it is not possible to define a global or superset of discriminative features that could discriminate between damaged and undamaged states of the structures, and simultaneously make a distinction between various modes of failures. In addition, one machine learning algorithm may show optimum performance for the discriminative features of a particular problem but fails for others. This article focuses on a review of discriminative features and the corresponding machine learning algorithms (both supervised and unsupervised), for various types of damage in smart composite structures.},

Short Time Fourier Transform (STFT) is employed to transform the transient responses into two-dimensional spectral frame representation. A convolutional neural network is incorporated to distinguish between the damaged and undamaged states, as well as various types of damage of the laminated composites, by automatically extracting discriminative features from the vibration-based spectrograms. The CNN showed a classification accuracy of 90.1% on one healthy and 12 delaminated cases. The study of the confusion matrix of CNN provided further insights into the physics of the problem.

abstract = {Structural health monitoring (SHM) is used worldwide for managing and maintaining civil infrastructures. SHM systems have produced huge amounts of data, but the effective monitoring, mining, and utilization of this data still need in-depth study. SHM data generally includes multiple types of anomalies caused by sensor faults or system malfunctions that can disturb structural analysis and assessment. In the routine data pre-processing, multiple signal processing techniques are required to detect the anomalies, respectively, which is inefficient. The large variations of extracted features from massive SHM data make the data anomaly detection techniques prone to be over-processed or under-processed. Even with expert intervention, the parameter tuning, associated with multiple data preprocessing methods, is still a challenge, making the procedure expensive and inefficient. In addition, one data anomaly detection technique frequently mis-detects other types of anomaly. In this work, we focus on the anomaly detection in the stage of data pre-processing that little work has been done based on the real-world continuous SHM data with multiclass anomalies. We proposed a novel data anomaly detection method based on a convolutional neural network (CNN) that imitates human vision and decision making. First, we split raw time series data into sections, and visualized the data in time and frequency domain, respectively. Then each section's images were stacked as a single dual-channel image and labeled according to graphical features (multi-2D image space expression). Second, a CNN was designed and trained for data anomaly classification, during which the descriptions and representations of the anomalies' features were learned by convolution. To validate our work, we considered the effects of balanced and imbalanced training sets and training ratios on actual acceleration data from an SHM system for a long-span cable-stayed bridge. The results show that our method could detect the multipattern anomalies of SHM data efficiently with high accuracy. The proposed dual-information CNN-based design makes this detection process readily scalable, faster, and more accurate, thereby providing a novel perspective with strong potential for SHM data preprocessing.},

abstract = {Damage diagnosis has been a challenging inverse problem in structural health monitoring. The main difficulty is characterizing the unknown relation between the measurements and damage patterns (i.e., damage indicator selection). Such damage indicators would ideally be able to identify the existence, location, and severity of damage. Therefore, this procedure requires complex data processing algorithms and dense sensor arrays, which brings computational intensity with it. To address this limitation, this paper introduces convolutional neural network (CNN), which is one of the major breakthroughs in image recognition, to the damage detection and localization problem. The CNN technique has the ability to discover abstract features and complex classifier boundaries that are able to distinguish various attributes of the problem. In this paper, a CNN topology was designed to classify simulated damaged and healthy cases and localize the damage when it exists. The performance of the proposed technique was evaluated through the finite-element simulations of undamaged and damaged structural connections. Samples were trained by using strain distributions as a consequence of various loads with several different crack scenarios. Completely new damage setups were introduced to the model during the testing process. Based on the findings of the proposed study, the damage diagnosis and localization were achieved with high accuracy, robustness, and computational efficiency.},

Thus, non-destructive evaluation methods that are material-independent and suitable for a wide range of defects identification are needed. In this paper, a technique for damage characterization in composite plates is proposed. In the presented non-destructive testing method, guided waves are excited by a piezoelectric transducer, attached to tested specimens, and measured by a scanning laser Doppler vibrometer in a dense grid of points. By means of signal processing, irregularities in wavefield images caused by any material defects are extracted and used for damage characterization. The effectiveness of the proposed technique is validated on four different composite panels: Carbon fiber-reinforced polymer, glass fiber-reinforced polymer, composite reinforced by randomly-oriented short glass fibers and aluminum-honeycomb core sandwich composite.

abstract = {This chapter presents an experimental investigation using high-velocity impact and low-velocity impact testing to detect and quantify impact damage for glass fiber-reinforced polymer (GFRP) type C-glass/Epoxy 600 g/m2 and type E-glass/Epoxy 800 g/m2 plate. GFRP type C-glass/Epoxy 600 g/m2 and type E-glass/Epoxy 800 g/m2 plates were tested using a single-stage gas gun and drop weight tester. For high-velocity impact, this research investigated the effect of specimen thickness, the type of projectiles, and the impact velocity, whereas for low-velocity impact, this research investigated the effects of specimen thickness based on the number of plies, and impact energy on the failure modes of GFRP type C-glass/Epoxy 600 g/m2 and type E-glass/Epoxy 800 g/m2 using nondestructive testing. The experimental results of the high-velocity impact test showed that both types of GFRP exhibited damage in terms of fiber cracking and fiber pull out, after being tested with four different gas gun pressures. For low-velocity impact tests, the results showed that both types of GFRP exhibited fiber crack and matrix crack. Most of the impacted specimens showed that GFRP type E-glass/Epoxy 800 g/m2 experienced a smaller damage area compared to type C-glass/Epoxy 600 g/m2. From the tests, the effect of the shape of the projectile, the target thickness, the gas gun pressure, and the impact energy on the performance of GFRP were determined. It can be concluded that GFRP type E-glass/Epoxy 800 g/m2 is stronger than GFRP type C-glass/Epoxy 600 g/m2 since it has more fiber volume as it is higher in density and has good mechanical properties. Therefore, GFRP type E-glass/Epoxy 800 g/m2 is recommended to be used in aircraft structure applications.},

abstract = {Long-term structural health monitoring (SHM) has become an important tool to ensure the safety of infrastructures. However, determining methods to extract valuable information from large amounts of data from SHM systems for effective identification of damage still remains a major challenge. This paper provides a novel effective method for structural damage detection by introduction of space and time windows in the traditional principal component analysis (PCA) technique. Numerical results with a planar beam model demonstrate that, due to the presence of space and time windows, the proposed double-window PCA method (DWPCA) has a higher sensitivity for damage identification than the previous method moving PCA (MPCA), which combines only time windows with PCA. Further studies indicate that the developed approach, as compared to the MPCA method, has a higher resolution in localizing damage by space windows and also in quantitative evaluation of damage severity. Finally, a finite-element model of a practical bridge is used to prove that the proposed DWPCA method has greater sensitivity for damage detection than traditional methods and potential for applications in practical engineering.},

In the MDOF system, roof acceleration is estimated through the input ground motion. Various cases of noise-contaminated signals are considered in this study, and the conventional multilayer perceptron (MLP) algorithm serves as a reference for the proposed CNN approach. According to the results from numerical simulations and experimental data, the proposed CNN approach is able to predict the structural responses accurately, and it is more robust against noisy data compared with the MLP algorithm. Moreover, the physical interpretation of CNN model is discussed in the context of structural dynamics. It is demonstrated that in some special cases, the convolution kernel has the capability of approximating the numerical integration operator, and the convolution layers attempt to extract the dominant frequency signature observed in the ideal target signal while eliminating irrelevant information during the training process.},

abstract = {Ultrasonic wavefield imaging with a non-contact technology can provide detailed information about the health status of an inspected structure. However, high spatial resolution, often necessary for accurate damage quantification, typically demands a long scanning time. In this work, we investigate a novel methodology to acquire high-resolution wavefields with a reduced number of measurement points to minimize the acquisition time. Such methodology is based on the combination of compressive sensing and convolutional neural networks to recover high spatial frequency information from low-resolution images. A data set was built from 652 wavefield images acquired with a laser Doppler vibrometer describing guided ultrasonic wave propagation in eight different structures, with and without various simulated defects. Out of those 652 images, 326 cases without defect and 326 cases with defect were used as a training database for the convolutional neural network. In addition, 273 wavefield images were used as a testing database to validate the proposed methodology. For quantitative evaluation, two image quality metrics were calculated and compared to those achieved with different recovery methods or by training the convolutional neural network with non-wavefield images data set. The results demonstrate the capability of the technique for enhancing image resolution and quality, as well as similarity to the wavefield acquired on the full high-resolution grid of scan points, while reducing the number of measurement points down to 10{\%} of the number of scan points for a full grid.},

The embedded structures are vulnerable subjected to seismic effects. After the seismic load, the integrity of the embedded structures is weakened but the damage is unlikely to be directly observed by engineers; as a result, damage detection of an embedded structure is critical. In this study, the identification of the structural damage is investigated with Wavelet and Fourier transforms. With these two approaches, the structural signal in different frequency domain can be analyzed. The advantages and disadvantages of these two approaches in identifying the damage locations are compared. An outstanding advantage of the Wavelet transform is that it is able to identify the damage location, which makes this approach attractive for engineering practice. This advantage is exemplified by a cantilever beam finite element model.},

In this model, the wind-induced responses are estimated by CNN trained with previously measured sensor signals; this enables the SHM system to operate stably even when a sensor fault or data loss occurs. In the presented model, top-level wind-induced displacement in the time and frequency domains, and wind data in the frequency domain are configured into the input map of the CNN to reflect the resisting capacity of a tall building, the change in the dynamic characteristics of the building due to wind loads, and the relationship between wind load and the building. To evaluate stress, which is used as a safety indicator for structural members in the building, the maximum and minimum strains of columns are set as the output layer of the CNN. The CNN is trained using measured wind and wind response data to predict the column strains during a future wind load. The presented model is validated using data from a wind tunnel test of a building model. The performance of the presented model is verified through strain estimation with data that were not used in the CNN training. To assess the validity of the presented input map configuration, the estimation performance is compared with a CNN that considered only the time domain responses as input. Furthermore, the effects of the variations in the configuration of the CNN on the wind response estimation performance are examined.},

abstract = {The rapid identification of kudzu powder of different origins is of great significance for studying the authenticity identification of Chinese medicine. The feasibility of rapidly identifying kudzu powder origin was investigated based on laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS) technology combined with chemometrics methods. The discriminant models based on the full spectrum include extreme learning machine (ELM), soft independent modeling of class analogy (SIMCA), K-nearest neighbor (KNN) and random forest (RF), and the accuracy of models was more than 99.00%. The prediction results of KNN and RF models were best: the accuracy of calibration and prediction sets of kudzu powder from different producing areas both reached 100%. The characteristic wavelengths were selected using principal component analysis (PCA) loadings. The accuracy of calibration set and the prediction set of discrimination models, based on characteristic wavelengths, is all higher than 98.00%. Random forest and KNN have the same excellent identification results, and the accuracy of calibration and prediction sets of kudzu powder from different producing areas reached 100%. Compared with the full spectrum discriminant analysis model, the discriminant analysis model based on the characteristic wavelength had almost the same discriminant effects, and the input variables were reduced by 99.92%. The results of this research show that the characteristic wavelength can be used instead of the LIBS full spectrum to quickly identify kudzu powder from different producing areas, which had the advantages of reducing input, simplifying the model, increasing the speed and improving the model effect. Therefore, LIBS technology is an effective method for rapid identification of kudzu powder from different habitats. This study provides a basis for LIBS to be applied in the genuineness and authenticity identification of Chinese medicine.},

Towards a smart monitoring system, this study proposes a hybrid deep learning algorithm aiming for structural damage detection tasks, which not only reduces required resources, including computational complexity, data storage but also has the capability to deal with different damage levels. The technique combines the ability to capture local connectivity of Convolution Neural Network and the well-known performance in accounting for long-term dependencies of Long-Short Term Memory network, into a single end-to-end architecture using directly raw acceleration time-series without requiring any signal preprocessing step. The proposed approach is applied to a series of experimentally measured vibration data from a three-story frame and successful in providing accurate damage identification results. Furthermore, parametric studies are carried out to demonstrate the robustness of this hybrid deep learning method when facing data corrupted by random noises, which is unavoidable in reality.

By means of early fault detection, severe damage can be avoided, allowing efficient timing of maintenance works and avoiding unnecessary inspections at the same time. These are the goals for structural health monitoring (SHM). The changes caused by incipient damage on raw data collected by sensors are quite small, and are usually contaminated by noise and varying environmental factors, so the algorithms used to extract information from sensor data need to focus on sensitive damage features. The developments of SHM techniques over the last 20 years have been more related to algorithm improvements than to sensor progress, which essentially have been maintained without major conceptual changes (with regards to accelerometers, piezoelectric wafers, and fiber optic sensors). The main different SHM systems (vibration methods, strain-based fiber optics methods, guided waves, acoustic emission, and nanoparticle-doped resins) are reviewed, and the main issues to be solved are identified. Reliability is the key question, and can only be demonstrated through a probability of detection (POD) analysis. Attention has only been paid to this issue over the last ten years, but now it is a growing trend. Simulation of the SHM system is needed in order to reduce the number of experiments.},

abstract = {A physics-based approach to structural health monitoring (SHM) has practical shortcomings which restrict its suitability to simple structures under well controlled environments. With the advances in information and sensing technology (sensors and sensor networks), it has become feasible to monitor large/diverse number of parameters in complex real-world structures either continuously or intermittently by employing large in-situ (wireless) sensor networks. The availability of this historical data has engendered a lot of interest in a data-driven approach as a natural and more viable option for realizing the goal of SHM in such structures. However, the lack of sensor data corresponding to different damage scenarios continues to remain a challenge. Most of the supervised machine-learning/deep-learning techniques, when trained using this inherently limited data, lack robustness and generalizability. Physics-informed learning, which involves the integration of domain knowledge into the learning process, is presented here as a potential remedy to this challenge. As a step towards the goal of automated damage detection (mathematically an inverse problem), preliminary results are presented from dynamic modelling of beam structures using physics-informed artificial neural networks. Forward and inverse problems involving partial differential equations are solved and comparisons reveal a clear superiority of physics-informed approach over one that is purely datadriven vis-{\`{a}}-vis overfitting/generalization. Other ways of incorporating domain knowledge into the machine learning pipeline are then presented through case-studies on various aspects of NDI/SHM (visual inspection, impact diagnosis). Lastly, as the final attribute of an optimal SHM approach, a sensing paradigm for non-contact full-field measurements for damage diagnosis is presented.},

At an insurance policy level, we show that for some policies up to 400 neural network runs are required to achieve stability.

In the latter case, the overall performance of the approach is associated with the accuracy of the model and the information that is used to define it. Although both approaches are widely used, data-driven algorithms are preferred in most cases because they afford the ability to analyze data acquired from sensors and to provide a real-time solution for decision making; however, these approaches involve high-performance processors due to the high computational cost.

abstract = {Recent developments tools and techniques for structural health monitoring allow the design of early warning systems for the damage diagnosis and structural assessment. Most methods to damage detection involve vibration data analysis by using identification systems that generally require a mathematical model and much information about the system, such as parameters and states that are mostly unknown. In this paper, a novel frequency domain convolutional neural network (FDCNN) proposed aims to design an identification system for damage detection based on Bouc–Wen hysteretic model. FDCNN, unlike other works, only requires acceleration measurements for damage diagnosis that are very sensitive to environmental noise. In contrast to neural network (NN) and time domain convolutional neural network, FDCNN reduces the computational time required for the learning stage and adds robustness against noise in data. The FDCNN includes random filters in the frequency domain to avoid measurement noise using a spectral pooling operation, which is useful when the system bandwidth is unknown. Incorrect filtering can produce unwanted results, as a shifted and attenuation signal relative to the original. Moreover, FDCNN allows overcoming the parameterization problem in nonlinear systems, which is often difficult to achieve. In order to validate the proposed methodology, a comparison between two different architectures of convolutional neural networks is made, showing that proposed CNN in frequency domain brings better performance in the identification system for damage diagnosis in building structures. Experimental results from reducing scale two-storey building confirm the effectiveness of the proposed.},

After the training process of original continuous deflection under 10-fold cross-validation, the model accuracy can reach 96.9% for damage classification with the performance outperforming that of the other four methods (random forest = 81.6%, support vector machine = 79.9%, k-nearest neighbor = 77.7%, and decision tree = 74.8%). The proposed model also demonstrated its decent abilities in automatically extracting damage features and distinguishing damage from structurally symmetrical locations.},

abstract = {A novel full wavefield processing method by using fully convolutional neural networks is presented. The full wavefield of propagating Lamb waves in the fibre-reinforced composite plate was simulated by the parallel spectral element method. It resembles a full wavefield measurements acquired on a surface of the plate by the scanning laser Doppler vibrometer. The aim of the proposed technique is an identification of delamination location, size and shape. It is achieved by pixel-wise image segmentation by using the end-to-end approach. It is possible because of the large dataset of Lamb wave propagation patterns resulting from interaction with delaminations of random location, size and shape. It is demonstrated that the proposed method, tested on numerical data, is performing better than conventional adaptive wavenumber filtering method which was developed in previous work. Moreover, it enables better automation of delamination identification so that the damage map can be created without user intervention. The method was also tested on experimental data acquired on the surface of the specimen in which delamination was artificially created by a Teflon insert. The obtained results with the deep learning approach show its capability to predict the delamination in the numerically generated dataset with high accuracy compared to the conventional damage detection approach. Furthermore, the deep learning model shows the ability to generalize to a further experiential set.},
