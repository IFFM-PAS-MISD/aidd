\section{Autoencoder ConvLSTM model}
\label{sec53}
In this section, the evaluation of the developed AE-ConvLSTM model will be presented on the numerical test data and, further, on the experimental data to demonstrate its capability to predict delamination location, shape, and size.
Hence, the four representative damage cases were selected from the numerical dataset to show the performance of the developed models.
For numerical cases, it should be noted that the predicted results were obtained by using only the first window of frames after the interaction with the damage, as the delamination ground truths are provided, which is not the case for real-life scenarios as in the experimental section. 
Consequently, the part of producing intermediate predictions and further calculating the RMS image was skipped (see Fig.~\ref{fig:Diagram_exp_predictions}).

\subsection{Numerical cases}
\label{sec531}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%In the first numerical case, the delamination is located at left edge of the plate, as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:RMS_448}, representing its ground truth (GT).
%This case is considered difficult due to edge wave reflections that have similar patterns as delamination reflection.
%The predicted output of the AEis shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:convlstm_pred_448}
%For the second numerical case, the delamination is located at the upper centre of the plate, as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:num_GT_462}, representing the GT.
%This case is also considered difficult due to the waves reflected from the edge have similar patterns to those reflected from the delamination.
%Figures~\ref{fig:Convlstm_num_462}, and~\ref{fig:AE_num_462} show prediction with respect to Model-\RNum{1}, and \RNum{2}, respectively.
%In the third case, the delamination is located in the upper left corner but a little farther from the edges, as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:num_GT_453}, representing the GT. 
%Figures~\ref{fig:Convlstm_num_453}, and \ref{fig:AE_num_453} show the predicted outputs with respect to Model-\RNum{1}, and \RNum{2}, respectively.
%As can be seen in all predicted outputs, our models are able to identify the delamination with high accuracy and without any noise.
%
%Table~\ref{tab:num_cases} presents the evaluation metrics for Model-\RNum{1} and~\RNum{2}, respectively, regarding the numerical cases shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:num_case}.
%Table~\ref{tab:num_cases} gathers the actual delamination area \(A\), predicted delamination area \(\hat{A}\), intersection over union \(IoU\) and percentage area error \(\epsilon\) with respect to each case. 
%The performance of the~Model-\RNum{2} is slightly better than the Model-~\RNum{1} for the selected delamination scenarios.
%However, all delamination cases should be considered for evaluation so the mean values of the proposed metrics were calculated next.
%
%Table~\ref{tab:meanIoU_vs_input} presents a comparison of the mean intersection over union (\(\overline{IoU}\)) for \(95\) numerical test cases with respect to the DL models.
%As shown in Table~\ref{tab:meanIoU_vs_input}, Model-\RNum{1} and Model-\RNum{2} are from the current work, and take as input animations of the full wavefields, whereas the rest of the models are from our previous works~\cite{Ijjeh2021, Ijjeh2022} and take as input RMS images.
%It can be concluded that the models that take animations as an input surpass the models that take only the RMS images as input. 
%Moreover, Model-\RNum{1} has a higher \(\overline{IoU}\) compared to Model-\RNum{2} (\(0.90\) versus \(0.87\)).
