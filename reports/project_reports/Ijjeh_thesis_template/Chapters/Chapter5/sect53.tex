\section{Autoencoder ConvLSTM model}
\label{sec53}
In this section, the evaluation of the developed AE-ConvLSTM model will be presented on the numerical test data and, further, on the experimental data to demonstrate its capability to predict delamination location, shape, and size.
Hence, the four representative damage cases were selected from the numerical dataset to show the performance of the developed models.
For numerical cases, it should be noted that the predicted results were obtained by using only the first window of frames after the interaction with the damage, as the delamination ground truths are provided, which is not the case for real-life scenarios as in the experimental section. 
Consequently, the part of producing intermediate predictions and further calculating the RMS image was skipped (see Fig.~\ref{fig:Diagram_exp_predictions}).

\subsection{Numerical cases}
\label{sec531}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
In the first numerical case, the delamination is located at left edge of the plate, as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:RMS_448}, representing its ground truth (GT).
This case is considered difficult due to edge wave reflections that have similar patterns as the delamination reflection.
The predicted output of the AE-ConvLSTM model is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:convlstm_pred_448}
In the second numerical test case, the delamination is located at the left upper corner of the plate, as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:RMS_456}, which represents the GT.
This case is also considered difficult due to the waves reflected from the edges have similar patterns to those reflected from the delamination.
Figure~\ref{fig:convlstm_pred_456} shows predicted damage map of AE-ConvLSTM model.
In the third case, the delamination is located in the upper centre of the edge as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:RMS_438}, representing the GT. 
Figure~\ref{fig:convlstm_pred_438} shows the predicted output of this case.
The fourth test case has a delamination located upper left quarter as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:RMS_397} representing the GT.
The predicted damage map of this case is presented in Fig.~\ref{fig:convlstm_pred_397}.

As shown in all predicted damage maps, the developed AE-ConvLSTM model can accurately identify the shape, size , and location of the delamination without any noise regardless of how difficult the test case is.

\subsection{Experimental cases}
\label{sec532}

\subsubsection{Single delamination}
\label{sec5321}
In this section, the investigation of AE-ConvLSTM model using experimentally acquired data of a single delamination case presented in subsection.~\ref{sec522} is presented. 
The Teflon of a square shape was inserted during specimen manufacturing, so its shape and location are known.
Based on that, the ground truth was prepared manually and it is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:exp_CFRP_teflon_3o_GT}. 
Furthermore, the number of full wavefield frames for this case is \(fn = 256\).
Figure~\ref{fig:convlstm_AE_CFRP_teflon_3o} shows the predicted output of the AE-ConvLSTM model for a window of frames \((72-96)\) for which the highest \(IoU=0.47\) was achieved.
Furthermore, the percentage area error metric \(\epsilon\) for AE-ConvLSTM model was equal to \(86.67\%\).

It should be noted that for the same damage scenario, the IoU value for the models developed previously in~\cite{Ijjeh2021} was low \((IoU=0.081)\).

The predictions were highest for the window of frames corresponding to the first interaction of the guided waves with the delamination.
Hence, such frames contain the most valuable feature patterns regarding delamination. 
This behaviour is depicted in Fig.~\ref{fig:CFRP_Teflon_3o_IoU_centre_window}, which shows the IoU values with respect to the predicted outputs as I slide the window over all input frames from the starting frame till the end.
Since there are \(256\) frames of full wavefield in this damage case, there are \(232\) windows.
Consequently, the AE-ConvLSTM model has \(232\) consecutive predictions.
Furthermore, in Fig.~\ref{fig:CFRP_Teflon_3o_center_frames} three places for the sliding window were selected. 
The first place depicted in a dark blue star shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:CFRP_teflon_3o_preds_frames} represents a window centered at frame \(fn=84\), which correspond to the initial interaction of guided waves with the delamination.
The second place is depicted in the pink pentagon shape shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:CFRP_teflon_3o_preds_frames} which represents a window centered at frame \(fn=141\) corresponding to guided waves reflected from the edges.
We can notice the drop in the \(IoU\) values as these frames have fewer damage features.
The third place, depicted in the green circle shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:CFRP_teflon_3o_preds_frames} represents a window centered at frame \(fn=218\) corresponding to the interaction of guided waves reflected from the edges with the delamination.
As we can see, the value of \(IoU\) increases again as the valuable feature patterns regarding delamination start to appear again.

The predicted outputs of AE-ConvLSTM model for windows centered at frame 84 (the dark blue star), frame 141 (pink pentagon), and frame 218 (the green circle) are shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:CFRP_Teflon_3o_predictions}.
Apart from correctly identified delamination, some noise is obtained near edges of the specimen.

Figure show the RMS image for the experimental case of single delamination predicted the AE-ConvLSTM model.
Additionally, to separate undamaged and damaged classes from the RMS images, we applied a binary threshold with a value \((threshold=0.5)\) as shown in Fig~\ref{fig:RMS_threshold_CFRP_Teflon_3o_ijjeh} 
The threshold level was selected to limit the influence of noise and, at the same time, highlight the damage.
The calculated \(IoU\) values for the case of single delamination is \(IoU=0.42\).

Table~\ref{tab:single_case} presents the evaluation metrics for the AE-ConvsLSTM model, regarding the experimental case of single delamination shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:RMS_threshold_CFRP_Teflon_3o_ijjeh}.
As shown in Table~\ref{tab:single_case}, the actual \(A\) and predicted areas \(\hat{A}\) of delaminations were computed in [mm\textsuperscript{2}] with respect to each case. 
The percentage area error \(\epsilon\) was calculated for both models accordingly.
