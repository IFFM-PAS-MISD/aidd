\subsection{Numerical cases}
\label{sec521}
In this section, five FCN models, including Res-UNet, VGG16 encoder-decoder, FCN-DenseNet, PSPNet, and GCN, were evaluated on four selected damage cases of an RMS (from the bottom surface of the plate).

The first exemplary delamination case is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:rms_first_case}. 
The delamination is located at the left edge of the plate, and it is surrounded by a line to represent its shape and location as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:RMS_bottom_448}.
Figures~\ref{fig:unet_269}-~\ref{fig:gcn_269} show the predicted output of the Res-UNet, VGG16 encoder-decoder, PSPNet, FCN-DenseNet and GCN models, respectively. 
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
All models properly indicate the location of the delamination. 
Moreover, pixels related to delamination location are clustered into a single spot without any additional noise. 
The GCN model better visually resembles the actual shape of the delamination than other models.

In the second delamination case, shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:rms_second_case}, the delamination is located at the upper left corner of the plate, and it is surrounded by an ellipse to represent its shape and location as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:RMS_bottom_456}.
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
This is the most challenging damage scenario because of reflections coming from plate edges overshadows reflections from damage.
As a result, changes in RMS patterns are barely visible.

In this delamination case the PSPNet model were not able to identify the damage.
However, the rest models perform reasonably well, considering the difficult damage scenario.

\subsection{Experimental cases}
\label{sec522}

In this section, FCN models are evaluated using experimentally acquired data.
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
Similarly to the synthetic dataset, we applied a frequency of \(50\)~kHz to excite a signal in a transducer placed at the centre of the plate. 
\(A0\) mode wavelength for this particular CFRP material at such frequency is about \(19.5\)~mm. 
The measurements were performed by using Polytec PSV-\(400\) SLDV on the bottom surface of the plate with dimensions of \(500\times 500\)~mm. 
The measurements were conducted on a regular grid of \(333\times333\) points. 
The measurement area was aligned with the plate edges.
The sampling frequency was \(512\)~kHz.
The experimental case is for a CFRP specimen with a single delamination.
A plain weave fabric reinforcement was used for manufacturing the composite specimen. 
The delamination between layers of the fabric was created artificially by a Teflon insert of a thickness 250 $\mu$m. 
The Teflon of a square shape was inserted during specimen manufacturing, so its shape and location are known. 
The number of full wavefield frames for this case is $f_n = 256$.
Furthermore, the measured full wavefield was further processed by an energy compensated RMS which takes into account wave attenuation. 
The results of such operation are shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:ERMS_with_label}.
The delamination is surrounded by a square frame representing its shape and location. 
Figures~(\ref{fig:unet_exp_erms} - \ref{fig:gcn_exp_erms}) shows delamination prediction maps for Res-UNet, VGG16 encoder-decoder, PSPNet, FCN-DenseNet and GCN models, receptively.
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Table~\ref{tab:rms_exp_case} presents the evaluation metrics for all FCN models, regarding the experimental case shown in Figs.~\ref{fig:exp_erms__case}.
Table~\ref{tab:rms_exp_case} gathers the actual delamination area \(A\), predicted delamination area \(\hat{A}\), intersection over union IoU and percentage area error \(\epsilon\) with respect to each FCN model. 
The overall performance of the GCN model is better than other models for the selected delamination scenarios.
Similarly to the numerical dataset, the best accuracy was achieved by using GCN.

It should be noted that the developed FCN-DenseNet model presented in~\cite{Ijjeh2021} was compared to the conventional adaptive wavenumber filtering method presented in~\cite{Kudela2015, Radzienski2019}.

%Furthermore, the FCN-DenseNet model showed better performance in delamination identification for numerical cases.
The FCN models show good generalisation behaviour in predicting the delamination in the unseen numerically generated data.
We can observe that the models can identify delamination with nearly no noise, indicating that the models can generalize and detect delamination on previously unseen data.
It has been shown that the achieved accuracy of the FCN models presented in~\cite{Ijjeh2022} surpasses the accuracy of previous models in~\cite{Ijjeh2021} with an improvement of 22.47\%.
Given that the provided models were only trained on a numerically generated dataset, they had a high degree of generalisation.
Additionally, the models show their ability to generalise by detecting the delamination in the experimentally acquired data.

Figure~\ref{fig:exp_erms_case_comp} presents a comparison between the predicted outputs regarding the experi\-mental case with the adaptive wavenumber filtering presented in~\cite{Kudela2015, Radzienski2019} and the two versions of the developed FCN-DenseNet models presented in~\cite{Ijjeh2021} and~\cite{Ijjeh2022}, respectively.
Figure.~\ref{fig:ERMSF} shows the damage map represents the energy-based root mean square index of frames filtered in the wavenumber domain (ERMSF).
To eliminate low values from the ERMSF, a binary threshold is applied as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:Binary_ERMSF}.
The threshold level was set to minimise the influence of edge noise while still highlighting the damage.
The calculated IoU equals $0.401$.
Figure.~\ref{fig:FCN_densenet_2021} shows the predicted output for the developed FCN-DenseNet model in~\cite{Ijjeh2021}, and the calculated IoU equals $0.081$. 
Fig.~\ref{fig:FCN_densenet_2022} shows the predicted output of the improved FCN-DenseNet model developed in~\cite{Ijjeh2022}, and the calculated IoU equals to $0.54$.
Accordingly, the improved version of the FCN-DenseNet model developed in~\cite{Ijjeh2022} surpasses both the adaptive wavenumber filtering method and the FCN-DenseNet model developed in~\cite{Ijjeh2021}.
