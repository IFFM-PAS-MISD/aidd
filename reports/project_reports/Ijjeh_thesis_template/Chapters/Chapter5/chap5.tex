\label{ch5}

In this chapter, the results and discussions regarding delamination identification in CFRP plates are presented. 
Accordingly, to verify the developed DL models, I evaluated them on \(95\) unseen numerical test cases and further on experimental test cases.
Moreover, I have selected four numerical test cases to present. 
The selected four numerical cases were chosen to represent the random distribution of delamination locations.
%Figure~\ref{numerical_cases} shows the selected numerical test cases that are evaluated and further presented will the developed models

Furthermore, I have applied the super-resolution image reconstruction technique to LR full wavefield animations for both the numerical test cases and the experimental case. 
Then, I applied the AE-ConvLSTM model to the reconstructed frames in order to identify the delamination.

Accordingly, to evaluate the performance of the proposed models, the intersection over union \(IoU\) (Jaccard index) was applied as the accuracy metric.
\(IoU\) is estimated by determining the intersection area between the ground truth and the predicted output.
Furthermore, we have two output classes (damaged and undamaged). 
The \(IoU\) was calculated for the damaged class only.
The illustration of the IoU metric is presented in Fig.~\ref{fig:iou} where Eqn.~(\ref{eqn:iou}) defines the \(IoU\) metric:

	\end{center}
	\caption{Intersection over union.} 
	\label{fig:iou}
\end{figure}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{equation}
	\textup{IoU}=\frac{Intersection}{Union}=\frac{\hat{Y} \cap Y}{\hat{Y} \cup Y},
	\label{eqn:iou}
\end{equation}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
where \(\hat{Y}\) is the predicted output, and \(Y\) is the ground truth (label).

Additionally, the percentage area error $\epsilon$ depicted in Eqn.~(\ref{eqn:mean_size_error}) was utilised to evaluate the performance of the FCN models and the Autoencoder ConvLSTM model:
\begin{equation}
	\epsilon=\frac{|A-\hat{A}|}{A} \times 100\%,
	\label{eqn:mean_size_error}
\end{equation}
where \(A\) and \(\hat{A}\) refer to the area in mm\textsuperscript{2} of the damage class in the ground truth and the predicted output, respectively.
Such a metric can indicate how close the area of the predicted delamination is to the ground truth.
Accordingly, the lower the value of $\epsilon$, the higher the accuracy of the identified damage. 

Two metrics are utilised for evaluating the DLSR model developed to perform super-resolution image reconstruction of the full wavefield.
The first metric is the peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR), which refers to the maximum possible power of a signal and the power of the distorting noise that affects the quality of its representation.
Equation~(\ref{PSNR}) depicts the mathematical representation of the PSNR:
\begin{equation}
	PSNR=20\log_{10}\left(\frac{R}{\sqrt{MSE}}\right),
	\label{PSNR}
\end{equation}
where \(R\) represents the maximum fluctuation value that exists in the input image, and its equal to \(255\), as I used an 8-bit unsigned integer data type.
\(MSE\) refers to the mean square error between the predicted output and the corresponding ground truth (see Eqn.~\ref{mse}).

The second utilised metric is the Pearson correlation coefficient that measures the linear relationship between two variable matrices \textbf{\(X\)} (represents the ground truth values) and \textbf{\(Y\)} (represents the predicted values), and its value is between -1 and 1, where:
\begin{itemize}
	\item -1 represents a perfect negative linear correlation,
	\item 0 represents no linear correlation,
	\item 1 represents a perfect positive linear correlation.
\end{itemize}
Equation~\ref{Pearson} depicts the mathematical formula to calculate Pearson CC commonly denoted as \(r_{xy}\):
\begin{equation}
	r_{xy} = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n}(x_i - \bar{x})(y_i-\bar{y})}{\sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^{n}(x_i - \bar{x})^2}\sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^{n}(y_i - \bar{y})^2}},
	\label{Pearson}
\end{equation}
where \(n\) is the number of sample points, \(x_i\), \(y_i\) are the individual value points representing the ground truth and predicted values, respectively, and \(\bar{x}\) is the mean value of the sample, analogously to \(\bar{y}\).


In the following, I will present and discuss the results of the developed CNN classifier models in section~\ref{sec51}. 
In section~\ref{sec52}, the results of the five developed FCN models will be presented and discussed.
Accordingly, a comparison between the developed FCN models will be made.
In section~\ref{sec53}, the results and discussion regarding the developed AE-ConvLSTM model are presented.
Finally, in section~\ref{sec54}, I will present the results of applying the developed DLSR model to numerical cases to identify the damage in the reconstructed frames.
Furthermore, I will apply the DLSR model to an experimental scenario to identify the delamination.
