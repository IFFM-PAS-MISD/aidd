\section{Objectives and motivations}
\label{sec13}

The main objective of the work is to develop an artificial intelligence (AI) driven diagnostic system for delamination identification in composite laminates.
Furthermore, to exploreÂ the potential of utilising artificial intelligence-based approaches to investigate damage detection and identification based on the propagation of Lamb waves.
Data corresponding to elastic wave propagation has very complex patterns of wave reflections. 
It is difficult to explicitly program instructions that will output a damage map of an element of a structure based on anomalies in propagating elastic waves (e.g., reflections from discontinuities).
Hence, this research aims to explore possible solutions that employ deep neural networks (DNN), as they are promising approaches.
The progress in the machine learning field in the last decade, along with increasing computation power capabilities, makes it a perfect time to investigate potential applica\-tions of DNN. 
DNN is an emerging tool that has successful applications in computer vision and speech recognition, among other applications. 
Nowadays, certain neural network (NN) architectures surpass human-level accuracy in image classification. 
The main advantage of DNN in comparison to other machine learning approaches is scalability. 
It means that the performance of DNN increases with NN size as well as the size of the dataset used for supervised learning.

\textbf{Therefore, it is possible to use an end-to-end approach in which DNN processes the animation of propagating waves (input) directly into a damage map (output).}

Another objective of this research is to address the issue of slow data acquisition of high-resolution full wavefields of Lamb wave propagation.
Hence, to overcome such an issue, I aim to develop a deep learning system capable of recovering the high-resolution frames of Lamb wave propagation and their interaction with delamination and boundaries from low-resolution measurements with high accuracy.
Consequently, such a system will speed up the data acquisition process.


This research will help answer legitimate questions regarding the utilisation of deep learning techniques by processing the full wavefield of propagating elastic waves for delamination identification in composite laminates:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Can the proposed AI-driven diagnostic model be more accurate than the conven\-tional signal processing technique?
	\item Knowing that experimental signals contain noise, is it adequate to use a numerical model for generating a dataset?
	\item Can a technique such as data augmentation enhance the training of deep learning models?
	\item How well can deep learning models generalise to new unseen data? Further, to experimental data acquired by SLDV?
	\item Is it computationally feasible to utilise all frames of propagating waves, or can utilisation of certain frames be efficient enough?
	\item Does the implementation of different deep learning architectures result in different accuracies in damage identification? Is the comparison metric among these architectures sufficient for determining the efficient one?
	\item Do deep learning techniques for delamination identification utilised in this thesis have any potential for practical applications in the long term?
	\item Can deep learning techniques developed for super-resolution image reconstruction be used to recover the high-resolution full wavefield frame from the low-resolution measurements with adequate accuracy to detect the damage?
\end{itemize}
