\section{Thesis contribution}
\label{sec14}
The novelty of this work consists of applying for the first time a full wavefield data of elastic waves propagation (numerically generated dataset) as an input to various supervised deep neural networks, which is capable of identifying damage.
Accordingly, two main approaches were adopted:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item One-to-one approach
	\item Many-to-one approach
\end{enumerate}

For the one-to-one approach, the developed models take one input image (RMS image of the full wavefield frames) and generates one output image of the damage map. 
The developed models that are based on one-to-one approach are:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Res-UNet
	\item VGG16 encoder-decoder
	\item PSPNet
	\item FCN-DenseNet
	\item GCN
\end{itemize}
Whereas, for the many-to-one approach, a number frames (representing the propagation of elastic waves) are fed to the developed models in order to generate a damage map.
For such approach, an autoencoder ConvLSTM models were developed.

Furthermore, we have developed deep learning models to perform an end-to-end superresulution technique regarding the elastic waves propagation and their interaction with the damage and the specimen boundaries.
Accordingly, a Low-Resolution (LR) input frame is captured using a uniform mesh, which is fed to deep learning model to produce a High-Resolution (HR) frame.
Later, the predicted HR frames are fed to the many-to-one models in order to identify the damage.
