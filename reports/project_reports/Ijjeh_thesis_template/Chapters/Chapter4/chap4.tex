%% CHAPTER INTRODUCTION ///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
In this chapter, I investigate several deep learning methodologies to detect and localise delamination in composite laminates.
The deep learning models were trained using a supervised scheme. 
Hence, it uses a training set to train the developed models to predict the desired output.
Accordingly, a synthetic dataset was built, representing the full wavefield of the Lamp waves propagating in a CFRP plate and their interaction with the delamination and the boundaries of the plate.
The acquisition process of the synthetic dataset is explained in details in the section~\ref{sec41}.

The developed methods are end-to-end approaches, in which the whole unprocessed training dataset is fed into the model.
Hence, it will learn by itself to identify distinct patterns and detect damage.
In section~\ref{sec42}, a fully connected CNN classifier model for detecting and localising delamination is presented in details.
In section~\ref{sec43}, I present five FCN models for delamination identification. Further, the developed models were trained using the RMS images in which the developed models are performing image pixel-wise image segmentation.
In section~\ref{sec44}, a deep learning model for delamination identification utilising the animation of full wavefield is presented.
Finally, in section~\ref{sec45}, I present a deep learning model for super-resolution image reconstruction.
Hence, the full wavefield of Lamb waves is recovered from low-resolution measurements into high-resolution measurements.
Accordingly, this can allow for a precise recovery of propagating waves and their interactions with delaminations and the boundaries of the plate.
Consequently, the reconstructed full wavefield can be used in damage imaging. 


All developed models were implemented and trained with the Keras API~\cite{chollet2015keras} running on top of TensorFlow~\cite{Abadi2016}.
The NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2070 with \(8\) GBs of memory was utilised to train the CNN classification models.
Furthermore, the NVIDIA Tesla V100 GPU with \(32\) GBs of memory was utilised to train the FCN models, the AE-ConvLSTM model, and the DLSR model.
