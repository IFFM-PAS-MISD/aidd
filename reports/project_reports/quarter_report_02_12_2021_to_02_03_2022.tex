	{\huge \textbf{Project work flow}}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Finalising my PhD thesis, currently writing the results and discussion and conclusions chapters.	
		\item A paper entitled "Deep learning approach for delamination identification using animation of Lamb waves" which was submitted to the journal of Mechanical Systems and Signal Processing (MSSP) is currently under review. 
		\item I have finished implementing and training super-resolution for full wavefield reconstruction model, which we add it to a paper entitled \enquote{Deep learning super-resolution for reconstruction of full wavefield of Lamb waves} that will be submitted to MSSP journal.
		\item A conference paper entitled \enquote{Delamination identification using global convolution networks} will be submitted to EWSHM 2022 conference, Palermo, Italy.
		\item An abstract paper entitled \enquote{Convolutional LSTM for delamination imaging in composite laminates} is submitted to 
		The 4th International Conference on Machine Learning and Intelligent Systems	(MLIS 2022), Seoul, Republic of Korea.
