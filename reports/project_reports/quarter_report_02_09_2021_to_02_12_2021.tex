	\begin{itemize}
		\item Start writing my PhD thesis, currently writing the methodology and results and discussion chapters.	
		\item A paper entitled \href{https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0888327021009948}{Deep learning based segmentation using full wavefield processing for delamination identification: A comparative study} was accepted in Mechanical Systems and Signal Processing
		Volume 168, 1 April 2022.
		\item I have attended two courses at the Tri-city Doctoral School, Polish Academy of Sciences:
		\begin{enumerate}
			\item Wood as a construction material for the 21st century
			\item Metamaterials and their potential applications in NDT/SHM		
		\end{enumerate}
		\item A paper entitled "Deep learning approach for delamination identification using animation of Lamb waves" which was submitted to the journal of Mechanical Systems and Signal Processing is currently under review. 
		\item Currently, I am working on training deep learning models to perform super-resolution (SR) reconstruction on the full wavefield wave propagation in CFRP. 
		Accordingly, several datasets of low resolution (LR) frames of full wavefield (based on random and uniform grids) with different compression ratios were prepared.
		\item A validation test of experimentally acquired data was applied on the implemented model of SR which showed a promising results.
